The paper discusses generic representations of countable abelian groups in Polish groups, focusing on the unitary group of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the automorphism group of a standard probability space, and the isometry group of the Urysohn metric space. The study aims to understand properties of the subgroup generated by generic representations and their extreme amenability. The results show that for certain cases, the generic representations are extremely amenable, and the centralizer of the generic representation is minimal under certain conditions. The paper also addresses questions about distinguishing generic groups for different abelian groups and the equality of centralizers for generic representations. The methods used involve category-preserving maps and a generalization of the Kuratowski-Ulam theorem.
