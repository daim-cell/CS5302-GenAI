The paper discusses the riggings of locally compact abelian groups, introducing a set of generalized eigenvectors for spectral decomposition in unitary representations. It focuses on Abelian locally compact groups, introducing rigged Hilbert spaces and spectral measure spaces. The Fourier transform on the dual group allows for representations in terms of generalized eigenfunctions. The characters of Abelian locally compact groups and positive type functions are also explored. The study concludes by showing the existence of riggings for unitary representations of Abelian locally compact groups.
