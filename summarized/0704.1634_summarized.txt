The paper discusses the concept of riggings of locally compact abelian groups in the context of unitary representations. It introduces a set of generalized eigenvectors that allow for a generalized spectral decomposition for a given unitary representation of a commutative, locally compact topological group. The riggings are obtained through suitable spectral measure spaces. The paper also explores the Fourier transform on abelian locally compact groups and the Gelfand transformation on the C*-algebra L1(G) to represent unitary representations in terms of generalized eigenfunctions. The existence of cyclic vectors and positive type functions is discussed, leading to a spectral decomposition for unitary operators in terms of generalized eigenvectors labeled by group characters. The paper emphasizes the importance of the Abelian property in the derivation and suggests potential extensions to nonabelian locally compact groups.
