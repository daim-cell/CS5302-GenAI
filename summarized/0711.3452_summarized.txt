The article pays tribute to Maurice Gross, a renowned linguist and pioneer in natural language processing. Gross is remembered for his contributions to formal linguistics and descriptive lexicology. He created Lexicon-Grammar tables, which are comprehensive resources for syntactico-semantic properties of lexical entries in French. Gross also conducted studies on predicative nouns, compounds, and idioms, challenging traditional linguistic theories. He advocated for linguistics-based processing, emphasizing the importance of manually constructed lexicons and grammars over corpora-based approaches. Gross's legacy includes an enduring research infrastructure, such as the RELEX network and International Conferences on Lexis and Grammar. Despite facing resistance initially, Gross's innovative work is now increasingly accepted in the scientific community. The article highlights Gross's critical views on scientific fashions and his emphasis on the importance of lexicons and grammars in language processing.
