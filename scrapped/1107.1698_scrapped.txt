arXiv:1107.1698v2  [math.LO]  23 Nov 2012GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREMEAMENABILITYJULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVABSTRACT . IfGis a Polish group and Γis a countable group, denote by Hom (Γ,G)the space of all homomorphisms Γ→G. We study properties of the group π(Γ)for the generic π∈Hom(Γ,G), when Γis abelian and Gis one of the followingthree groups: the unitary group of an infinite-dimensional H ilbert space, the au-tomorphism group of a standard probability space, and the is ometry group of theUrysohn metric space. Under mild assumptions on Γ, we prove that in the firstcase, there is (up to isomorphism of topological groups) a un ique generic π(Γ);in the other two, we show that the generic π(Γ)is extremely amenable. We alsoshow that if Γis torsion-free, the centralizer of the generic πis as small as possible,extending a result of Chacon–Schwartzbauer from ergodic th eory.1. I NTRODUCTIONArepresentation of a countable group Γinto a Polish group Gis a homomor-phism Γ→G. In the case when Gis the group of symmetries of a certain objectX, a representation can be thought of as an action Γ/archrightdownXthat preserves the rel-evant structure; by varying Xone obtains settings of rather different flavor. Forexample, representation theory studies linear representa tions, while understand-ing homomorphisms Γ→Aut(μ)(or, equivalently, measure-preserving actions ofΓon a standard probability space (X,μ)) is the subject of ergodic theory.In this paper, we take a global view and, rather than study spe cific representa-tions, we are interested in the space of all representations Hom(Γ,G). Hom(Γ,G)is a closed subspace of the Polish space GΓand is therefore also Polish. It isequipped with a natural action of Gby conjugation(g·π)(γ) =gπ(γ)g−1, for π∈Hom(Γ,G),g∈Gand if two representations are conjugate, one usually consi ders them as isomor-phic. We are interested in generic properties of representations (that is, propertiesthat hold for a comeager set of π∈Hom(Γ,G)) that are moreover invariant undertheG-action. We note that when Γis the free group Fn, Hom(Γ,G)can be canoni-cally identified with Gn(and in particular, as a G-space, Hom (Z,G)is isomorphictoGequipped with the action by conjugation).A very special situation is when the action G/archrightdownHom(Γ,G)has a comeagerorbit; then, studying generic invariant properties of repr esentations amounts tounderstanding the single generic point. Identifying when a comeager orbit ex-ists has been the focus of active research during the last yea rs, and looking forgeneric conjugacy classes is a well established topic in the study of automorphism2010 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Hodges–Hodkinson–Lascar –Shelah [HHLS] in-troduced the notion of ample generics (a Polish group Ghasample generics if thereis a generic element in Hom (Fn,G)for every n) and gave the first examples, thenKechris–Rosendal [KR] undertook a systematic study of this notion; more recently,Rosendal [R2] proved that there is a generic point in Hom (Γ, Iso(QU))for anyfinitely generated abelian Γ(QU is the rational Urysohn space).In many situations, however, it turns out that orbits are mea ger. Important ex-amples of this phenomenon come from ergodic theory (that is, when G=Aut(μ)),and identifying generic properties in that setting has a lon g history, especially inthe case Γ=Z: for example, Halmos proved that the generic transformatio n inAut(μ)is weakly mixing and has rank 1. We refer the reader to Kechris ’s book [K2]for a detailed study of the spaces Hom (Γ, Aut(μ))for various groups Γ.In this paper, we study properties of the subgroup π(Γ)≤Gfor a genericπ∈Hom(Γ,G). Our first theorem is quite general and may be considered as astarting point for the rest of the results. Recall that a Poli sh group is called extremelyamenable if every continuous action of the group on a compact Hausdorf f space hasa fixed point. We recommend Pestov’s book [P2] as a general ref erence on extremeamenability.Theorem 1.1. LetΓbe a countable group and G a Polish group. Then the set{π:π(Γ)is extremely amenable }is G δinHom(Γ,G).Of course, it is possible that generically π(Γ)is dense in G, for instance thisoften happens when Γis free. The easiest way to ensure that we are in a non-trivial situation is to assume that Γsatisfies some global law, for example that itis abelian. For that reason (among others), in the rest of the paper, we specializeto abelian groups Γand three examples for G: the unitary group of a separable,infinite-dimensional Hilbert space U(H), the group of measure-preserving auto-morphisms of a standard probability space Aut (μ), and the group of isometriesof the universal Urysohn metric space Iso (U)(see [LPR+] for background on theUrysohn space). Conjugacy classes are meager in Hom (Γ,U(H))for any count-able infinite Γ[KLP]; it is an open question whether this is true for the othe r twogroups. The orbits in Hom (Γ, Aut(μ))are known to be meager for any infiniteamenable Γ[FW]. For Iso (U), the situation is less clear, though we prove here,using a technique due to Rosendal, that conjugacy classes in Hom(Γ, Iso(U))aremeager for all torsion-free abelian Γ(see Theorem 8.10).Of major importance in this paper is the group L0(T): the Polish group of(equivalence classes of) measurable maps ([0, 1],λ)→T, where λdenotes theLebesgue measure, Tis the torus, the group operation is pointwise multiplicati on,and the topology is given by convergence in measure (equival ently, L0(T)can beviewed as the unitary group of the abelian von Neumann algebr aL∞([0, 1])). Twoimportant facts about this group, proved by Glasner [G2], ar e that it is monothetic(contains a dense cyclic subgroup) and that it is extremely a menable.Recall that an abelian group is called bounded if there is an upper bound for theorders of its elements and unbounded otherwise. Even though our results hold in aslightly greater generality, in order to avoid introducing technical definitions, westate them here only for unbounded groups.GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 3In the case of the unitary group, using spectral theory, we ar e able to identifyexactly the group π(Γ)for a generic π.Theorem 1.2. LetΓbe a countable, unbounded, abelian group. Then the set{π:π(Γ)∼=L0(T)}is comeager in Hom(Γ,U(H)).For our other two examples, we are unable to decide whether ge nerically oneobtains a single group.Question 1.3.For Geither Aut (μ)or Iso(U), does there exist a Polish group Hsuch that for the generic π∈Hom(Z,G),π(Z)∼=H? In particular, is this true forH=L0(T)?This question was also raised (for Aut (μ)) by Solecki and by Pestov. Solecki [S2]recently found some evidence that the answer might be positi ve for Aut (μ): heproved that the closed subgroup generated by a generic π∈Hom(Z, Aut(μ))isa continuous homomorphic image of a closed subspace of L0(R)and contains anincreasing union of finite dimensional tori whose union is de nse.A related problem was posed by Glasner and Weiss [GW]: is π(Z)a L ́ evy groupfor the generic π∈Hom(Z, Aut(μ))? Recall that L0(T)is L ́ evy and that everyL ́ evy group is extremely amenable (see [P2] for background o n L ́ evy groups).Even though the questions above remain open, using Theorem 1 .1, we can stillshow that extreme amenability is generic.Theorem 1.4. LetΓbe a countable, unbounded, abelian group and G be one of Aut(μ)orIso(U). Then the set{π:π(Γ)∼=L0(T)}is dense in Hom(Γ,G)and therefore, the generic π(Γ)is extremely amenable.In the special case Γ=Zand G=Iso(U), this answers a question of Glas-ner and Pestov ([P3, Question 8]). The methods used in the pro of of the theoremalso show that the generic monothetic group (that is, the generic completion of Z) isextremely amenable (see Theorem 6.4).A natural question that arises is how one can distinguish the generic groupsπ(Γ)for different abelian groups Γ. It turns out that, at least for finitely generatedfree abelian groups, this is impossible.Theorem 1.5. Let G be either Aut(μ)orIso(U), let P be a property of abelian Polishgroups such that the set {π∈Hom(Z,G):π(Z)has P}has the Baire property, and letd be a positive integer. Then the following are equivalent:(i)for the generic π∈Hom(Z,G),π(Z)has property P;(ii)for the generic π∈Hom(Zd,G),π(Zd)has property P.In particular, the theorem implies that the generic π(Zd)is monothetic. It alsoimplies that if the answer of Question 1.3 is positive for Z, then it is positive forany Zdand moreover, one obtains the same generic group. Finally, i n the caseG=Aut(μ), a result of Ageev allows us to replace Zdby any countable abelian Γcontaining an infinite cyclic subgroup (cf. Subsection 8.3) .4 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVNext we apply our techniques to studying stabilizers of repr esentations. If π∈Hom(Γ,G), denote by C(π)thecentralizer ofπ, i.e.,C(π) ={g∈G:gπ(γ) =π(γ)gfor all γ∈Γ}.ThenC(π)is a closed subgroup of Gand π(Γ)≤ C(π)ifΓis abelian. Our nextresult shows that, for a generic π, we often have equality.Theorem 1.6. Let G be either Aut(μ)orIso(U)and Γbe a countable, non-trivial,torsion-free, abelian group. Then for a generic π∈Hom(Γ,G),C(π) =π(Γ).For G=Aut(μ)and Γ=Z, this result seems to have been stated explicitlyfor the first time in [ACS], where it is attributed to Chacon-S chwartzbauer [CS]1.Our approach is different in that it is based on maps between s uitable Polishspaces which behave well with respect to Baire category noti ons, which we callcategory-preserving maps , and a generalization of the Kuratowski–Ulam theorem(see Appendix A). Such maps were first used in a similar settin g by King [K3],were explicitly defined by Ageev [A1], and also feature promi nently in the pa-pers Tikhonov [T] and Stepin–Eremenko [SE]. Tikhonov [T], w ho proved that thegeneric action of Zdcan be embedded in a flow, was the first to consider actions ofabelian groups other than Z.We conclude with an amusing application of the methods devel oped in thispaper. All three target groups that we consider ( U(H), Aut(μ), Iso(U)) are knownto be L ́ evy and therefore extremely amenable. Using Theorem 1.1, we are able togive a “uniform” proof for their extreme amenability that do es not pass throughthe fact that they are L ́ evy groups (but it does use the extrem e amenability of L0(K)for compact groups K, and those are L ́ evy).Theorem 1.7. Let G be either of U (H),Aut(μ),Iso(U); denote by U (n)the unitarygroup of dimension n and by F∞the free group on א0generators. Then the set{π∈Hom(F∞,G):∃nπ(F∞)∼=L0(U(n))}is dense in Hom(F∞,G).Corollary 1.8 (Gromov–Milman [GM]; Giordano–Pestov [GP]; Pestov [P1]) .Thethree groups U (H),Aut(μ), and Iso(U)are extremely amenable.Notation. All groups are written multiplicatively and the neutral ele ment is al-ways denoted by 1. When Gis a group and A⊆G, we denote by /a\}bracketle{tA/a\}bracketri}htthe subgroupofGgenerated by A.(X,μ)is an atomless standard probability space; we writeAut(X,μ)or simply Aut (μ)to denote the group of measure-preserving bijectionsofXmodulo a.e. equality (equipped with its usual Polish topolo gy).His a sep-arable, infinite-dimensional, complex Hilbert space and U(H)denotes its unitarygroup endowed with the strong operator topology. If Gis a Polish group, L0(G)denotes the group of all (equivalence classes of) measurabl e maps from (X,μ)toGwith pointwise multiplication and the topology of converge nce in measure (see[K2, Section 19] for basic facts about those groups). Someti mes, when we need toexplicitly mention the source measure space, we may write L0(X,μ,G).Zdenotes1In an ealier version of this paper this result was incorrectl y attributed to King, who proved astronger statement, namely, that the conclusion of the theo rem holds for rank-1 transformations.

P RELIMINARIES ON ABELIAN GROUPSIn this section, we prove several preliminary lemmas about a belian groups thatwill be useful in the sequel.By a classical theorem of Pr  ̈ ufer (see [F2, Theorem 17.2]), e very bounded count-able abelian group is a direct sum of cyclic groups, moreover , the functionmΓ:{pn:pprime, n∈N+} → N∪{∞}indicating the number of summands isomorphic to Z(pn)is a complete isomor-phism invariant for bounded abelian groups; note that for su ch groups, mΓhasonly finitely many non-zero values.Consider the following property of a bounded abelian group:(∗) ∀p∀n m Γ(pn)>0=⇒ ∃ k≥n m Γ(pk) =∞.The reason we are interested in it is that a bounded abelian gr oup without ( ∗)cannot be densely embedded in an extremely amenable group. M ore precisely, wehave the following.Proposition 2.1. LetΓbe a bounded abelian group that does not have property (∗). Thenany Hausdorff topological group G in which Γcan be embedded as a dense subgroup has anon-trivial open subgroup of finite index.Proof. Letpand nbe such that 0 <mΓ(pn)<∞and mΓ(pm) = 0 for all m>n.Letkbe the product of all orders of elements of Gnot divisible by pand considerthe closed subgroup H≤Ggiven byH={g∈G:gkpn−1=1}.Then H∩Γhas finite index in Γ(the quotient Γ/(H∩Γ)being isomorphic toZ(p)mΓ(pn)), showing that Hhas finite index in Gand is therefore open (if Γ=/uniontextni=1γi(H∩Γ), then/uniontextni=1γiHis closed and contains Γ). /squareIfΓis bounded, denote by HΓthe subgroup of Tgenerated by{exp(2πi/pn):mΓ(pn) =∞}and note that HΓis finite, cyclic, and that if Γhas property ( ∗), every character ofΓtakes values in HΓ.6 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVFor any countable abelian group Γ, denote by ˆΓits dual, i.e., the group of allhomomorphisms Γ→T, and recall that as Γis discrete, ˆΓis compact.Lemma 2.2. LetΓbe a countable abelian group and let e :Γ→Γnbe the diagonal em-bedding.(i)IfΓis unbounded, then the set{φ∈ˆΓn:φ(e(Γ))is dense in Tn}is dense G δinˆΓn.(ii)IfΓis bounded and has property (∗), then the set{φ∈ˆΓn:φ(e(Γ)) = HnΓ}is dense G δinˆΓn.Proof. In both cases it is clear that the set is Gδ, so we only have to check that it isdense. We will use the fact that every character of a subgroup ∆≤Γextends to acharacter of Γ(see [F1, Corollary 4.41]).(i)Case 1. Γcontains an element of infinite order γ0. Denote by ∆the cyclic sub-group generated by γ0and let θ:ˆΓ→ˆ∆be the dual of the inclusion map ∆→Γ.LetUbe an open set in ˆΓn. Find φ∈Usuch that θ(φ1), . . . , θ(φn)are independentover Q(this is possible because θis an open map and the set of rationally inde-pendent tuples is dense in ˆ∆n). Then by Kronecker’s theorem, φ(e(∆))is dense inTn.Case 2. Γis torsion. By Baire’s theorem, it suffices to show that for an y openV⊆Tn, the open set of φ∈ˆΓnsuch that there exists γ∈Γwith φ(e(γ))∈Visdense.We let ddenote the usual (shortest geodesic) metric on the torus. A b asic opensetUinˆΓnhas the formU={φ∈ˆΓn:∀f∈F∀i≤nφi(f) =θi(f)},where Fis a finite subgroup of Γand θi∈ˆF. Let also Vbe given byV={x∈Tn: maxid(xi,bi)<ǫ}for some b∈Tnand ǫ>0. Let γ0be an element of Γof order greater than |F|/ǫ.Letkbe the least positive integer such that γk0∈Fand note that k>1/ǫ. Let ∆be the subgroup of Γgenerated by Fand γ0. For i≤n, choose ci∈Tsuch thatd(ci,bi)<ǫand cki=θi(γk0)(this is possible because as k>1/ǫ, the preimage ofany point in Tunder the map x/mapsto→xkisǫ-dense) and define ψi∈ˆ∆byψi(γj0f) =cjiθi(f), for j∈Z,f∈F.(ψiis well-defined because of the choice of ci.) Now extend each ψito an elementφi∈ˆΓ. Then by definition, φ∈Uand φ(e(γ0))∈V.(ii) Let p1, . . . , pkdenote the prime numbers dividing the orders of elements ofΓ, and n1, . . . , nkthe integers such that mΓ(pnii) =∞and mΓ(pni) =0 for all n>ni.Pick a non-empty open U⊆ˆΓnand x= (x1, . . . , xn)∈HnΓ; we need to show thatthere exists φ∈Usuch that x∈φ(Γ).There exists ψ= (ψ1, . . . , ψn)∈ˆΓnand a finite subgroup ∆≤Γsuch thatany element of ˆΓncoinciding with ψon∆belongs to U. From Pr  ̈ ufer’s structuretheorem and property ( ∗), we see that there exists γ∈Γof order pn11···pnkkandGENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 7such that /a\}bracketle{tγ/a\}bracketri}ht∩∆={1}. The order of xdivides pn11···pnkk, so we may extend eachψito a character φiof/a\}bracketle{t∆,γ/a\}bracketri}ht∼=∆×/a\}bracketle{tγ/a\}bracketri}htby setting φi(γ) = xi. Further extending(φ1, . . . , φn)to an element of ˆΓn, we are done. /squareDefinition 2.3. Letn≤ א 0. A topological group Gis called generically n-generatedif the set of n-tuples(g1, . . . , gn)∈Gnthat generate a dense subgroup of Gis denseGδinGn.Gisgenerically monothetic if it is generically 1-generated.Note that in the definition above, the condition that the set b eGδis automatic, soone only has to check that it is dense. Note also that if Gis generically n-generated,then it is generically m-generated for every m≥nand that every Polish group isgenerically א0-generated.The idea of the proof of the next proposition comes from Kechr is [K2, p. 26],where by a similar argument he showed that U(H)is generically 2-generated.Proposition 2.4. LetΓbe a countable abelian group.(i)IfΓis unbounded, then{π∈Hom(Γ,L0(T)):π(Γ)is dense in L0(T)}is dense G δinHom(Γ,L0(T)). In particular, L0(T)is generically monothetic.(ii)IfΓis bounded and has property (∗), then{π∈Hom(Γ,L0(HΓ)):π(Γ)is dense in L0(HΓ)}is dense G δinHom(Γ,L0(HΓ)).Proof. (i) Let Kndenote the subgroup of L0([0, 1],λ,T)consisting of all functionsthat are constant on intervals of the type [i2−n,(i+1)2−n]. Then Knis isomor-phic to T2n, the sequence {Kn}is increasing, and/uniontextnKnis dense in L0(T). It iseasy to check that whenever Γis finitely generated,/uniontextnHom(Γ,Kn)is dense inHom(Γ,L0(T))and by using again the result about extension of characters f romsubgroups, we obtain that this is true for all Γ.Thanks to the Baire category theorem, we only need to show tha t for any non-empty open subset UofL0(T), the open set{φ∈Hom(Γ,L0(T)):φ(Γ)∩U/\e}atio\slash=∅}is dense in Hom (Γ,L0(T)). So, pick a non-empty open subset Vof Hom(Γ,L0(T))and let nbe big enough that Kn∩U/\e}atio\slash=∅and Hom (Γ,Kn)∩V/\e}atio\slash=∅. UsingLemma 2.2 (i), we know that we can find some φ∈Hom(Γ,Kn)∩Vsuch thatφ(Γ)∩U/\e}atio\slash=∅, which concludes the proof.(ii) The same proof, with obvious modifications, works. /square3. E XTREME AMENABILITY IS A GδPROPERTYThe following theorem, while simple, is the key tool for all o f our results re-garding extreme amenability.Theorem 3.1. Let G be a Polish group and Γbe a countable group. Then the set{π∈Hom(Γ,G):π(Γ)is extremely amenable }is G δinHom(Γ,G).8 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVProof. We begin by fixing a left-invariant metric dinducing the topology of G.Recall from [P2, Theorem 2.1.11] that π(Γ)is extremely amenable if and only ifthe left-translation action of π(Γ)on(π(Γ),d)is finitely oscillation stable. From[P2, Theorem 1.1.18], we know that this is equivalent to the f ollowing condition:(3.1)∀ǫ>0∀Ffinite⊆π(Γ)∃Kfinite⊆π(Γ)∀c:K→ {0, 1}∃i∈ {0, 1} ∃g∈π(Γ)∀f∈F∃k∈c−1(i)d(g f,k)<ǫ.In fact, the above property is implied by item (10) of [P2, The orem 1.1.18] andimplies item (8) of that same theorem, which lists equivalen t conditions for anaction to be finitely oscillation stable.We claim that (3.1) is equivalent to the following property:(3.2)∀ǫ>0∀Afinite⊆Γ∃Bfinite⊆Γ∀c:B→ {0, 1}∃i∈ {0, 1} ∃γ∈Γ∀a∈A∃δ∈c−1(i)d(π(γa),π(δ))<ǫ.Indeed, since any coloring of π(Γ)defines a coloring of Γ, it is clear that (3.2) isstronger than (3.1). To see the converse, assume that condit ion (3.1) is satisfiedand fix ǫ>0 and a finite subset AofΓ. Then (3.1) applied to ǫand F=π(A)yields a finite subset Kofπ(Γ)and we can pick a finite B⊆Γsuch that π(B) =K.We claim that this Bwitnesses that condition (3.2) is satisfied. To see this, fix a nenumeration {γn}n<ωofΓ. Given c:B→ { 0, 1}, we define cK:K→ { 0, 1}bysettingcK(k) =c(γi)where i=min{j:γj∈Band π(γj) =k}.To conclude, it is enough to notice that the definition of cKensures that for anyi∈ {0, 1}and any k∈c−1K(i), there is some δ∈Bwith π(δ) =kand c(δ) =i.It is easily checked that (3.2) is a Gδcondition on π, and we are done. /squareBelow, we will work with π(Γ)rather than π(Γ). When it comes to extremeamenability the difference is immaterial since π(Γ)is extremely amenable if andonly if π(Γ)is extremely amenable.Remark. LetΓbe a countable group. When endowed with the pointwise conver -gence topology, the space D(Γ)of bi-invariant distances on Γis a Polish space, andthe proof above also shows that the set{d∈D(Γ):(Γ,d)is extremely amenable }isGδinD(Γ). Indeed, any group endowed with a bi-invariant distance is a utomat-ically a topological group, and the reasoning above leads to a criterion for extremeamenability which is a Gδcondition on d.4. T HE UNITARY GROUPIn this section, we study generic unitary representations o f abelian groups Γ,that is, generic elements of Hom (Γ,U(H)), whereHis a separable, infinite-dimensionalHilbert space.Lemma 4.1. LetΓbe an abelian group. Then the set{π∈Hom(Γ,U(H)):πis a direct sum of finite-dimensional representations }is dense in Hom(Γ,U(H)).GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 9Proof. This is a direct consequence of [K2, Proposition H.2], [BdlH V, Proposi-tion F.2.7], and the fact that irreducible representations of abelian groups are one-dimensional. /squareRecall that a vector ξ∈ H iscyclic for the representation πif the span of{π(γ)ξ:γ∈Γ}is dense in H.Lemma 4.2. LetΓbe an infinite abelian group and ξbe a unit vector in H. Then the set{π∈Hom(Γ,U(H)):ξis a cyclic vector for π}is dense G δinHom(Γ,U(H)).Proof. We will first show that the set{(π,ξ)∈Hom(Γ,U(H))×H :ξis a cyclic vector for π}is comeager. By Baire’s theorem, we only need to check that fo r a given non-emptyopen set A⊆ H , the open set{(π,ξ):∃γ1, . . . , γn∈Γ∃c1, . . . , cn∈C∑iciπ(γ)ξ∈A}is dense in Hom (Γ,U(H))×H . Fix A, an open set V⊆Hom(Γ,U(H)), and anopen set B⊆ H . By Lemma 4.1, there is π∈V, aπ-invariant finite-dimensionalsubspace K ⊆ H and vectors ξ∈B∩ K and η∈A∩ K. As every finite-dimensional representation of Γis a direct sum of characters, there exists an or-thonormal basis {ei}ni=1ofKand φ∈ˆΓnsuch that π(γ)ei=/a\}bracketle{tγ,φi/a\}bracketri}htei. Let ξ=∑iaiei. By slightly modifying ξif necessary, we can also assume that ai/\e}atio\slash=0 foralli. As Γis infinite, ˆΓis perfect, so without leaving V, we can assume that thecharacters φ1, . . . , φnare distinct. By a classical theorem of Artin (see for instan ce[L, Theorem 4.1]), they are then linearly independent, so th ere exist γ1, . . . , γn∈Γsuch that det (/a\}bracketle{tγj,φi/a\}bracketri}ht)ni,j=1/\e}atio\slash=0. We thus havedet/parenleftbigai/a\}bracketle{tγj,φi/a\}bracketri}ht/parenrightbigni,j=1=/parenleftBig∏iai/parenrightBig(det/a\}bracketle{tγj,φi/a\}bracketri}ht)/\e}atio\slash=0,so the vectors π(γj)ξ=∑iai/a\}bracketle{tγj,φi/a\}bracketri}hteiare linearly independent. Every tuple of nindependent vectors spans K; in particular, η∈span{π(γj)ξ:j≤n}.Now by the Kuratowski–Ulam theorem [K1, 8.41], there exists ξ∈ H for whichthe set{π∈Hom(Γ,U(H)):ξis a cyclic vector for π}is comeager. By homogeneity, this is in fact true for every ξ/\e}atio\slash=0. Finally, to seethat the set is Gδ, it suffices to write down the definition. /squareIfπ:Γ→U(H)is a representation of the countable abelian group Γand ξ∈ His a unit vector, let φπ,ξbe the positive-definite function corresponding to ξ, i.e.,φπ,ξ(γ) =/a\}bracketle{tπ(γ)ξ,ξ/a\}bracketri}ht.By Bochner’s theorem [F1, Theorem 4.18], there exists a uniq ue Borel probabilitymeasure μπ,ξonˆΓsuch that(4.1)/integraldisplay/a\}bracketle{tγ,x/a\}bracketri}htdμπ,ξ(x) =φπ,ξ(γ)for all γ∈Γ.Also, the map (π,ξ)/mapsto→μπ,ξis continuous.10 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVThen the cyclic subrepresentation of πgenerated by ξis isomorphic to the rep-resentation of ΓonL2(ˆΓ,μπ,ξ)given by(4.2) (γ·f)(x) =/a\}bracketle{tγ,x/a\}bracketri}htf(x)with cyclic vector the constant 1. This representation natu rally extends to a repre-sentation of the C∗-algebra C(ˆΓ)which we will again denote by π.Lemma 4.3. LetΓbe an infinite abelian group and ξa unit vector in H. Then the set{π∈Hom(Γ,U(H)):ξis a cyclic vector for πandμπ,ξis non-atomic }is dense G δinHom(Γ,U(H)).Proof. Note that μπ,ξis non-atomic iff the cyclic subrepresentation of πgeneratedbyξisweakly mixing , i.e., does not contain finite-dimensional subrepresentat ions.Apply Lemma 4.2, then use Proposition H.11 and Theorem H.12 f rom [K2]. /squareWe are now ready to prove the main theorem of this section.Theorem 4.4. LetΓbe a countable abelian group.(i)IfΓis unbounded, then the set{π∈Hom(Γ,U(H)):π(Γ)∼=L0(T)}is comeager in Hom(Γ,U(H)).(ii)IfΓis bounded and has property (∗), then the set{π∈Hom(Γ,U(H)):π(Γ)∼=L0(HΓ)}is comeager in Hom(Γ,U(H)).Proof. Again, we only give the proof for (i), the proof of (ii) being s imilar.LetDbe a countable dense subset of C(ˆΓ,T)(the space of all continuous func-tions ˆΓ→Twith the uniform convergence topology) and Ea countable densesubset of the unit sphere of H. Define the set C1⊆Hom(Γ,U(H))byπ∈C1⇐⇒ ∀ ǫ>0∀f∈D∀η1, . . . , ηk∈E∃γ∈Γ∀i≤k/bardblπ(f)ηi−π(γ)ηi/bardbl<ǫ.We will show that C1is dense Gδ. By Baire’s theorem, it suffices to show that forfixed ǫ>0,f∈D, and η1, . . . , ηk∈E, the open set of πsatisfying the condi-tion on the the second line of the definition of C1is dense. Fix an open set V⊆Hom(Γ,U(H)). By Lemma 4.1, there exist π∈V, a finite-dimensional π-invariantsubspace K ⊆ H and η′1, . . . , η′k∈ K such that for all i≤k,/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleηi−η′i/vextenddouble/vextenddouble<ǫ/4 and/vextenddouble/vextenddoubleη′i/vextenddouble/vextenddouble≤1. As before, there exists an orthonormal basis e1, . . . , enofKand φ∈ˆΓnsuch that π(γ)(ej) =/a\}bracketle{tγ,φj/a\}bracketri}htejfor all γ∈Γand j≤n. By Lemma 2.2, we can,without leaving V, further assume that φ(Γ)is dense in Tn. Find now γ∈Γsuchthat|/a\}bracketle{tγ,φj/a\}bracketri}ht−f(φj)|<ǫ/2 for all j≤n. Then for every η=∑jajej∈ K,/bardblπ(f)η−π(γ)η/bardbl2=/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble∑jaj(f(φj)−/a\}bracketle{tγ,φj/a\}bracketri}ht)ej/vextenddouble/vextenddouble/vextenddouble2≤∑j|aj|2(ǫ/2)2= (ǫ/2)2/bardblη/bardbl2,so using the choice of Kand the fact that both π(f)and π(γ)are unitary, weobtain that /bardblπ(f)ηi−π(γ)ηi/bardbl<ǫfor all i≤kas required.GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 11Fix a unit vector ξ∈ H and define the set C2⊆Hom(Γ,U(H))byπ∈C2⇐⇒ π∈C1and ξis cyclic for πand μπ,ξis non-atomic.By Lemma 4.2, Lemma 4.3, and the argument above, C2is dense Gδ. We nowshow that for every π∈C2,π(Γ)∼=L0(T). Fix π∈C2and write μforμπ,ξ. Asξis cyclic, πis isomorphic to the representation on L2(ˆΓ,μ)given by (4.2), so wecan identify Hwith L2(ˆΓ,μ). Note that L0(ˆΓ,μ,T)embeds as a closed subgroupofU(L2(ˆΓ,μ))(acting by pointwise multiplication) and that we can view π(Γ)as a subgroup of L0(ˆΓ,μ,T). As μis non-atomic, it now suffices to check thatπ(Γ)is dense in L0(ˆΓ,μ,T). We first observe that the natural homomorphismθ2:C(ˆΓ,T)→L0(ˆΓ,μ,T)has a dense image. Indeed, consider the commutativediagramC(ˆΓ,R)θ1/d47/d47e1/d15/d15L1(ˆΓ,μ,R)e2/d15/d15C(ˆΓ,T)θ2/d47/d47L0(ˆΓ,μ,T),where the horizontal arrows denote the quotient maps by μ-a.e. equivalence andthe vertical ones are the exponential maps f/mapsto→ei f. As the image of θ1is denseand e2is surjective, we obtain that the image of θ2is also dense. Now consider anopen subset of L0(ˆΓ,μ,T)of the formV={g∈L0(ˆΓ,μ,T):∀i≤k/bardblf·ηi−g·ηi/bardbl<ǫ}for some f∈D,η1, . . . , ηk∈Eand ǫ>0. As L0(ˆΓ,μ,T)is a closed subgroup ofU(L2(ˆΓ,μ))and θ2(D)is dense in L0(ˆΓ,μ,T), sets of this form form a basis for thetopology of L0. As π∈C1, each such open set meets π(Γ), finishing the proof. /square5. Aut(μ)Now, we turn to the study of generic measure-preserving acti ons of count-able abelian groups Γon a standard probability space, i.e., generic elements ofHom(Γ, Aut(μ)). Specifically, we prove the following theorem.Theorem 5.1. LetΓbe a countable abelian group which is either unbounded or bou ndedwith property (∗). Then{π∈Hom(Γ, Aut(μ)):π(Γ)is extremely amenable }is dense G δinHom(Γ, Aut(μ)).We recall that a homomorphism π∈Hom(Γ, Aut(X,μ))can be viewed as ameasure-preserving action of ΓonX. Such an action is called (essentially) free if forallγ∈Γ\{1},μ({x∈X:π(γ)·x=x}) =0. It is well-known that for abelian Γ,the conjugacy class of any free action of Γis dense (see, e.g., [FW, Claim 19]). Sincethe isomorphism type of π(Γ)is invariant under conjugacy, it suffices, in viewof Theorem 3.1, to prove that there exists a single free actio nπsuch that π(Γ)isextremely amenable. For this, we will use the Gaussian const ruction, which wequickly recall. As a reference for the facts stated below wit hout proof, we refer thereader to [K2, Appendix E] and [KTD, Lecture 4].12 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVLetνdenote the standard Gaussian measure on Rand let(X,μ) = ( RN,νN).Letpi:RN→R,i∈Nbe the projection functions. Then piare independentGaussian random variables, pi∈L2(X,μ,R), and/a\}bracketle{tpi,pj/a\}bracketri}ht=δijfor all i,j. Let Hbe the closed subspace of L2(X,μ,R)spanned by the pis (known as the first chaos ).For every orthogonal operator T∈O(H), we can define a measure-preservingtransformation  ̃T:X→Xby ̃T(x)(n) = ( Tpn)(x).Then T/mapsto→ ̃Tis a topological group isomorphism between the orthogonal g roupO(H)and a closed subgroup of Aut (μ). We next check that each  ̃T/\e}atio\slash=id obtainedin this manner acts freely. Indeed, Tpn−pnis a Gaussian random variable forevery n, thereforeμ({x:(Tpn)(x) =pn(x)})>0=⇒Tpn=pn,whence μ({ ̃T=id})>0 implies that T=id.The construction described above applies to a real Hilbert s pace, yet, to useour results from the previous sections, we need to embed the u nitary group of acomplex separable Hilbert space Hinto Aut(μ). This is achieved by first taking therealification HRofH, then embedding the unitary group of Hinto the orthogonalgroup of HRin the natural way, and then applying the Gaussian construct ion toHR.Proof of Theorem 5.1. Letφ:L0(T)→Aut(μ)denote the composition of the em-beddingsL0(T)→U(H)→Aut(μ),where the first embedding is obtained by identifying Hwith L2([0, 1],λ)and let-ting L0(T) = L0([0, 1],λ,T)act on it by pointwise multiplication, and the second,by the Gaussian construction outlined above. Let π:Γ→L0(T)be a homomor-phism with a dense image in the unbounded case and a homomorph ism whoseimage is dense in the copy of L0(HΓ)sitting naturally inside L0(T)in the boundedone (such a homomorphism exists by Proposition 2.4). Then φ◦πis a free actionofΓsuch that (φ◦π)(Γ)is extremely amenable, which, by the remarks above, issufficient to prove the theorem. /squareRemark. We are grateful to the referee for pointing out that the actio ns producedvia the Gaussian construction are free, thus simplifying ou r original proof of The-orem 5.1. The embedding φ:L0(T)→Aut(μ)that we describe above had alreadybeen considered by Glasner and Weiss [GW, p. 1537].6. T HEURYSOHN SPACEWe next consider generic representations of countable abel ian groups by isome-tries of the Urysohn space, i.e., generic elements of Hom (Γ, Iso(U)). We refer thereader to the volume [LPR+] for information about the Urysohn space Uand itsbounded variant, the Urysohn sphere U1; Chapter 5 of [P2] is also a good source ofinformation. Let us note that all the results proved here are also true for Iso (U1),and the proofs are essentially the same as those given below. To simplify the ex-position, we focus on Iso (U).GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 13The next lemma is a metric variant of the induction construct ion of Mackeyand will be used in many of our arguments about representatio ns in the isometrygroup of the Urysohn space.Lemma 6.1. Let K be a Polish group admitting a compatible bi-invariant m etric andΓ≤K be a discrete subgroup. Let (Z,dZ)be a bounded Polish metric space on which Γacts faithfully by isometries. Then there exists a bounded P olish metric space (Y,dY), acontinuous, faithful, isometric action K /archrightdownY, and an isometric, Γ-equivariant embeddinge:Z→Y.Proof. Fix a compatible bounded bi-invariant metric δonK(note that δis neces-sarily complete, see, for instance, [G1, 2.2.2]) such that(6.1) infγ∈Γ\{1}δ(1,γ)>diam Z.PutX=K×Zand equip it with the metricdX((k1,z1),(k2,z2)) = max(δ(k1,k2),dZ(z1,z2)).The group Γacts on Xisometrically on the right by(k,z)·γ= (kγ,γ−1·z).SetY=X/Γand equip it with the metricdY(x1Γ,x2Γ) = infγ1,γ2dX(x1·γ1,x2·γ2) =infγdX(x1,x2·γ).Note that dYis indeed a metric because the Γ-action is by isometries and each xΓis closed. It is also not difficult to see that dYis complete.The group Kacts on Yon the left byk·(k′,z)Γ= (kk′,z)Γ.This action is by isometries, and is easily seen to be continu ous. Define e:Z→Ybye(z) = ( 1,z)Γ. We check that eisΓ-equivariant:e(γ·z) = ( 1,γ·z)Γ= (γ,z)Γ=γ·(1,z)Γ=γ·e(z).We finally check that eis an isometric embedding. Using (6.1) and the fact that Γacts on Zby isometries, we have:dY(e(z1),e(z2)) = dY((1,z1)Γ,(1,z2)Γ)=infγ1,γ2{dX((γ1,γ−11·z1),(γ2,γ−12·z2))}=infγ1,γ2{max(δ(γ1,γ2),dZ(γ−11·z1,γ−12·z2))}=dZ(z1,z2).To see that the action is faithful, note that k·(1,z)Γ= (1,z)Γimplies that k∈Γand k·z=z. Since the action Γ/archrightdownZis assumed to be faithful, we are done. /squareWe recall for future reference that compact Polish groups, a s well as abelianPolish groups, admit a compatible bi-invariant metric (see , e.g., [HR, 8.3 and 8.9]).For our construction below, we need to introduce some notati on: whenever(Y,dY)is a bounded Polish metric space, we consider the space L1(Y)of all (equiv-alence classes of) measurable maps from a standard probabil ity space (X,μ)toY,14 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVendowed with the metricd(f,g) =/integraldisplayXdY(f(x),g(x))dμ(x).Then L1(Y)is a Polish metric space in which Yembeds isometrically (as constantfunctions). Also, if Gis a Polish group acting continuously on Yby isometries, theaction G/archrightdownYextends to an isometric action L0(G)/archrightdownL1(Y)defined by(g·f)(x) =g(x)·f(x).This action is continuous, faithful if the original action G/archrightdownYis faithful, and theimage of L0(G)in the isometry group of L1(Y)is closed if Gis a closed subgroupof Iso(Y).Lemma 6.2. (i)LetΓbe an unbounded abelian group. Then the set{π∈Hom(Γ, Iso(U)):π(Γ)∼=L0(T)}is dense in Hom(Γ, Iso(U)).(ii)LetΓbe a bounded abelian group with property (∗). Then the set{π∈Hom(Γ, Iso(U)):π(Γ)∼=L0(HΓ)}is dense in Hom(Γ, Iso(U)).Proof. (i) We denote G=Iso(U). Note that open sets in Hom (Γ,G)of the form{π:d(π(γ)a,π0(γ)a)<ǫfor all γ∈F,a∈A},where π0∈Hom(Γ,G),ǫ>0,Fis a finite subset of Γ, and Ais a finite subset ofU, form a basis for the topology of Hom (Γ,G). We will show that every such openset contains a πsuch that π(Γ)∼=L0(T).To that end, fix π0,ǫ,F, and A. Denote by ∆the subgroup of ΓgeneratedbyF. As ∆is residually finite, we may apply [PU, Theorem 1] to find an act ionπ1:∆/archrightdownUsuch that d(π1(γ)a,π0(γ)a)<ǫfor all γ∈F,a∈Aand such that π1has finite range in Iso (U). Let Bdenote the (finite) closure of Aunder π1, and ∆′be the image of ∆in Iso(B). Find an integer nsuch that ∆′embeds as a subgroupofTn. By Lemma 6.1, there exists a bounded Polish metric space Yand a faithfulaction of TnonYwhich extends the action ∆′/archrightdownB. The natural homomorphism∆→Tnextends to a homomorphism Γ→Tnwhich we denote by φ. The actionTn/archrightdownYgives rise, as explained above, to an action L0(Tn)/archrightdownL1(Y)which extendsthe action Tn/archrightdownY, and we may identify L0(Tn)with its image in Iso (L1(Y)). Bythe Katˇ etov construction (see, e.g., [P2, pp. 109–111, 115 ]), the action Iso (L1(Y))/archrightdownL1(Y)extends to an action Iso (L1(Y))/archrightdownU, and Iso (L1(Y))embeds as a closedsubgroup of G. Thus we have identified L0(Tn)with a closed subgroup of G.The composition of the homomorphismsΓ→Tn→L0(Tn)→Gdefines an element πof Hom(Γ,G)and we can assume, using the homogeneity ofU, that for all γ∈∆, one has π(γ)|A=π1(γ)|A, hence π∈U. Now by perturbingπslightly, using Proposition 2.4, we can arrange so that πis still in Ubutπ(Γ)isdense in L0(Tn). As L0(Tn)is closed in G, we obtain that π(Γ) = L0(Tn)∼=L0(T),finishing the proof.(ii) Essentially the same proof works (replacing everywher eTbyHΓ)./squareGENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 15The next theorem follows immediately from Lemma 6.2 and Theo rem 3.1.Theorem 6.3. LetΓbe a countable abelian group, and assume that Γis either unboundedor is bounded and has property (∗). Then{π∈Hom(Γ, Iso(U)):π(Γ)is extremely amenable }is dense G δinHom(Γ, Iso(U)).Remark. We note that, in view of Proposition 2.1, Theorem 5.1 and Theo rem 6.3 arebest possible, in the sense that the condition on Γcannot be replaced with a moregeneral one.Recall that, whenever Γis a countable group, the space D(Γ)of all bi-invariantdistances on Γendowed with the pointwise convergence topology is a Polishspace.Theorem 6.4. LetΓbe a countable abelian group which is either unbounded or is b oundedand has property (∗). Then the set{ρ∈D(Γ):(Γ,ρ)is extremely amenable }is dense G δin D(Γ).Proof. Given the remark at the end of Section 3, it is enough to prove t hat the setofρfor which (Γ,ρ)is extremely amenable is dense in D(Γ).Letρ0denote an invariant distance on Γ. By the Katˇ etov construction, thereexists a metric embedding j:(Γ,ρ0)→Uand a homomorphism π:Γ→Iso(U)such that the left translation action Γ/archrightdown(Γ,ρ0)and Γ/archrightdownπj(Γ)are isomorphic. Fixa finite subset AofΓand ǫ>0, and let Obe the open neighborhood of ρ0inD(Γ)consisting of all ρsuch that∀γ∈A|ρ(γ, 1Γ)−ρ0(γ, 1Γ)|<ǫ.By Theorem 6.3, we know that there exists  ̃π∈Hom(Γ, Iso(U))such that  ̃π(Γ)isextremely amenable,  ̃πis injective (since the generic  ̃πis injective), and∀γ∈A d( ̃π(γ)(j(1Γ)),π(γ)(j(1Γ)))<ǫ.Letσdenote a left-invariant distance on Iso (U)compatible with its topology andnote that, as Γis abelian, σ| ̃π(Γ)is bi-invariant. For any integer N>0, one canconsider the bi-invariant distance ρNonΓdefined byρN(γ1,γ2) =d( ̃π(γ1)(j(1Γ)), ̃π(γ2)(j(1Γ)))+1Nσ( ̃π(γ1), ̃π(γ2))=ρ0(γ1,γ2)+1Nσ( ̃π(γ1), ̃π(γ2)).Then ρNbelongs to OforNlarge enough; also,  ̃π:(Γ,ρN)→( ̃π(Γ),σ)is a uni-form isomorphism, whence (Γ,ρN)is isomorphic to  ̃π(Γ)as a topological groupand therefore extremely amenable. /square7. T HE EXTREME AMENABILITY OF U(H), Aut(μ)AND Iso(U)In this section, we describe how to deduce the extreme amenab ility of U(H),Aut(μ), and Iso (U)from the extreme amenability of L0(K), where Kis compact(see [G2] or [P2]), and Theorem 3.1. Even though the extreme a menability of thosegroups is known, we think that our “uniform” proof is interes ting in its own right.16 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVWe recall that any Polish group is generically א0-generated; it is then clear thatthe following theorem, along with Theorem 3.1 and the fact th atL0(U(m))is ex-tremely amenable for all m, implies the extreme amenability of our three groups.Theorem 7.1. Let G be either of U (H),Aut(μ),Iso(U). Then the set{π∈Hom(F∞,G):∃mπ(F∞)∼=L0(U(m))}is dense in Hom(F∞,G).Proof. It suffices to show that for every n,{(g1, . . . , gn)∈Gn:∃m/a\}bracketle{tg1, . . . , gn/a\}bracketri}htis contained in a closed copy of L0(U(m))}is dense. Indeed, any open set in Hom (F∞,G)is specified by imposing conditionson finitely many generators, say a1, . . . , an; if we can arrange that π(a1), . . . , π(an)are contained in a closed copy of L0(U(m)), we can use the other generators toensure that π(F∞)∼=L0(U(m)).The unitary group . We fix an orthonormal basis {ei}ofHand letH(m) =span(e1, . . . , em). Identify the finite-dimensional unitary group U(m)with thesubgroup of U(H)that acts trivially on H(m)⊥. Fix a non-empty open subsetVofU(H)n. Find msufficiently large and a tuple (g1, . . . , gn)∈V∩U(m)nsuch that whenever (h1, . . . , hn)∈U(H)nagrees with (g1, . . . , gn)onH(m), then(h1, . . . , hn)∈V.The action U(m)/archrightdownH(m)extends naturally to an actionL0(U(m)) = L0([0, 1],λ,U(m))/archrightdownL2([0, 1],λ,H(m)).This gives a homeomorphic embedding of L0(U(m))as a closed subgroup of theunitary group of L2([0, 1],λ,H(m)). Denote by e:U(m)→U(L2([0, 1],λ,H(m)))the composition of the embeddings U(m)→L0(U(m))→U(L2([0, 1],λ,H(m))).LetT:L2([0, 1],λ,H(m))→ H be a unitary isomorphism that is the identity onH(m)(we seeH(m)as a subspace of L2([0, 1],λ,H(m))by identifying it with thesubspace of constant functions), so that Tconjugates the two actions of U(m)onH(m). Finally, let (h1, . . . , hn) =Te((g1, . . . , gn))T−1and observe that (h1, . . . , hn)∈Vand h1, . . . , hnare contained in the subgroup T(L0(U(m)))≤U(H).The isometry group of the Urysohn space . In that case, the proof is basically thesame as that of Lemma 6.2. Pick a non-empty open subset Vof Iso(U)n, anduse the fact that Fnis residually finite and [PU, Theorem 1] to find (g1, . . . , gn)belonging to Vand generating a finite subgroup ∆. Then pick a finite subset AofUsuch that ∆/archrightdownAand any tuple coinciding with (g1, . . . , gn)onAbelongstoV; let ∆′denote the image of ∆in Iso(A). Let m=|∆′|; then ∆′embeds inthe unitary group U(m)(by its left-regular representation). Using Lemma 6.1, theaction ∆′/archrightdownAextends to a faithful action U(m)/archrightdownYfor some bounded Polishmetric space Y, which then extends to an action L0(U(m))/archrightdownL1(Y), and L0(U(m))is isomorphic to the corresponding subgroup of Iso (L1(Y)). Applying the Katˇ etovconstruction and using the homogeneity of U, we obtain (h1, . . . , hn)∈Vsuchthat the subgroup generated by (h1, . . . , hn)is contained in an isomorphic copy ofL0(U(m)).The automorphism group of (X,μ). Call an action Fn/archrightdown(X,μ)finite if it factorsthrough the action of a finite group. It is an immediate conseq uence of the factthat Aut(μ)has a locally finite dense subgroup that the finite actions of FnareGENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 17dense. Fix now an open neighborhood Vof a finite action Fn/archrightdownφ0(X,μ)that fac-tors through the finite group ∆. As free actions of ∆are dense in Hom (∆, Aut(μ)),we can assume that the action ψ0of∆induced by φ0is free. Let mbe the orderof∆and, as above, identify ∆with a subgroup of U(m)via the left-regular rep-resentation. Let (Y,ν)be a standard probability space and consider the measure-preserving action L0(Y,ν,U(m))/archrightdownaY×U(m)defined byf·(y,u) = ( y,f(y)u)and observe that this action gives an embedding of L0(Y,ν,U(m))as a closed sub-group of Aut (Y×U(m),ν×Haar), which we identify with Aut (μ). As a|∆is freeand any two free actions of ∆are conjugate, we can assume that ψ0=a|∆. Denot-ing by φthe action of Fninduced by a|∆, we thus have that φ∈Vand φ(Fn)iscontained in an isomorphic copy of L0(U(m)). /squareRemark. In fact, each of these three groups is generically 2-generat ed: for U(H)thisis proved on page 26 of [K2]; for Aut (μ)it is a result of Prasad [P4]; and for Iso (U),this is a recent result of Slutsky [S1, 4.19]. Hence, for the a bove proof, it would beenough to only consider pairs of elements of G. If one wants to follow that route,one also needs the fact that L0(U(m))is generically 2-generated; actually, L0(K)isgenerically 2-generated whenever Kis compact, connected and metrizable, a factthat can be proved using the arguments of Proposition 2.4 and a classical resultof Schreier and Ulam [SU] stating that any compact, connecte d and metrizabletopological group is generically 2-generated.8. G ENERIC PROPERTIES OF HOMOMORPHISMS FROM TORSION -FREE ABELIANGROUPS INTO Aut(μ)AND Iso(U)We now turn to the question: how much do generic properties of π(Γ)dependon the (abelian) group Γ? Of course, if Γis bounded, then the group π(Γ)is alsobounded and, in general, it will be different from a generic π(Z). However, asit turns out, if the target group is Aut (μ)or Iso(U), and one restricts attentionto free abelian groups, the generic properties of π(Zd)do not depend on d. Asanother application of our techniques (together with some B aire category toolsdeveloped in Appendix A), we also identify exactly the centr alizers of genericπ(Γ)for torsion-free groups Γ.8.1. A criterion for monotheticity. We now prove a simple criterion that will al-low us to show that the generic π(Γ)is monothetic (of course, π(Z)is alwaysmonothetic but this is not a priori clear for other groups Γ).Proposition 8.1. Let G be a Polish group, Γa countable group. Suppose that for everyδ∈Γ,γ∈Γ\{1}, the setAγ,δ={π∈Hom(Γ,G):π(δ)∈ /a\}bracketle{tπ(γ)/a\}bracketri}ht}is dense. Then both setsB1={π∈Hom(Γ,G):π(Γ)is generically monothetic }andB2={π∈Hom(Γ,G):/a\}bracketle{tπ(γ)/a\}bracketri}htis dense in π(Γ)for every γ∈Γ\{1}}are dense G δ.18 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVProof. First we check that B1isGδ. Let{Un}be a basis for the topology of G. Wehaveπ∈B1⇐⇒/parenleftBig∀m,n/parenleftbigπ(Γ)∩Um/\e}atio\slash=∅and π(Γ)∩Un/\e}atio\slash=∅/parenrightbig=⇒/parenleftbig∃γ∈Γ,k∈Zπ(γ)∈Umand π(γk)∈Un/parenrightbig/parenrightBig.Indeed, if π(Γ)is generically monothetic, then the set of topological gene ratorsis dense; taking Un,Umas above, there exists a topological generator gofπ(Γ)belonging to Um, and some gkmust belong to Un. Since gis a limit of elementsofπ(Γ), one can find γsuch that π(γ)∈Umand π(γk)∈Un. Conversely, if thecondition on the right-hand side of the equivalence above is satisfied, then for eachopen non-empty subset Uofπ(Γ), the set of all g∈π(Γ)such that /a\}bracketle{tg/a\}bracketri}ht∩U/\e}atio\slash=∅is open and dense in π(Γ); the intersection of all these sets as Uranges over acountable basis for the topology of π(Γ)is the set of all topological generators ofπ(Γ), which is thus dense Gδ.Then, we show that Bγ,δ={π∈Hom(Γ,G):π(δ)∈/a\}bracketle{tπ(γ)/a\}bracketri}ht}isGδ. As B2isthe intersection of all Bγ,δ(γ∈Γ\{1},δ∈Γ), this will show that B2isGδ. Wehaveπ∈Bγ,δ⇐⇒/parenleftBig∀n/parenleftbigπ(δ)∈Un=⇒ ∃ k∈Zπ(γk)∈Un/parenrightbig/parenrightBig.Finally, as B2⊆B1, it suffices to check that B2is dense. This is a direct consequenceof Baire’s theorem and the fact that Aγ,δ⊆Bγ,δ. /squareThe following theorem is the main technical tool for our appl ications.Theorem 8.2. Let G be one of Aut(μ)andIso(U), and let Γbe a countable, torsion-free,abelian group. Then the sets{π∈Hom(Γ,G):π(Γ)is generically monothetic }and{π∈Hom(Γ,G):∀γ∈Γ\{1}/a\}bracketle{tπ(γ)/a\}bracketri}ht=π(Γ)}are dense G δinHom(Γ,G).Proof. We show that both Aut (μ)and Iso(U)satisfy the hypothesis of Proposi-tion 8.1. In what follows, denote by e1, . . . , edbe the standard generators of Zd.We begin with the case G=Aut(μ); the following is a consequence of theRokhlin lemma for free abelian groups [C, Theorem 3.1].Lemma 8.3.

Note also that ∆′is cyclic and q(γ)is a generator. Considernow ∆′as a subgroup of T, so that qbecomes a character of ∆. Then qextends to ahomomorphism Γ→T(still denoted by q); denote its image by Γ′.LetΓ′/archrightdownψ′XΓ′/∆′be the action of Γ′co-induced from ψ(see, e.g., [K2, 10 (G)] fordetails on co-induction) and let Θ:XΓ′/∆′→Xbe the factor map, Θ(ω) =ω(∆′),which is ∆′-equivariant. Denote by Bthe finite measurable partition generated byAand ψ(A), letT:XΓ′/∆′→Xbe any measure-preserving isomorphism such thatT−1(B) =Θ−1(B)for all B∈ B, and define π:Γ→Aut(μ)byπ=q◦(Tψ′T−1).It is clear that π∈Uand π(δ)∈ /a\}bracketle{tπ(γ)/a\}bracketri}ht(asπ(γ)is a generator of π(∆)). Thisconcludes the proof for G=Aut(μ).For Iso(U), we adapt an argument of Pestov and Uspenskij [PU].Lemma 8.4. Let n be a non-negative integer, Λ=Zd∗Fnand C be a finite subset ofΛ. Then there exists an integer M such that for any p 1, . . . , pd≥M, there exists a finitegroup L and a morphism q :Λ→L such that q |Cis injective and q (ei)has order p iforall i≤d.Proof. Leta1, . . . , anbe generators of Fn.

Then,pick any pigreater than M=2N+1. Let q0:Λ→(∏di=1Z(pi))∗Fnbe thehomomorphism defined by extending the canonical projection Zd→∏di=1Z(pi).Note that the restriction q0|Cis one-to-one, and each q0(ei)has order pi. Now letC′=q0(Zd)∪q0(C). Since free products of residually finite groups are residu-ally finite (see [G3], or [P2, 5.3.5]) and C′is finite, there exists a finite group Landa morphism q1:(∏di=1Z(pi))∗Fn→Lsuch that the restriction q1|C′is injective.Setting q=q1◦q0, the lemma is proved. /squareWith this new ingredient, we obtain the following variant on Lemma 4 of [PU].Lemma 8.5. (variation on Pestov–Uspenskij [PU]) LetΛ=Zd∗Fn, and K be a finitesubset of Λ. Fix a left-invariant pseudometric on Λwhose restriction to K is a metric.Then there exists M ∈Nsuch that for any p 1, . . . , pd≥M there exists a finite group L,a morphism q :Λ→L and a left-invariant metric on L such that:•the restriction of q to K is distance-preserving;•q(ei)has order p i.Proof. The proof is exactly the same as in [PU], using Lemma 8.4 above instead ofsimply using the fact that Λis residually finite. /squareRedoing the proof of Theorem 1 in [PU], with Lemma 8.5 replaci ng their Lemma 4,we obtain the following result.20 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVTheorem 8.6 (variation on Pestov–Uspenskij [PU, Theorem 1]) .Let G=Iso(U)and U be a non-empty open subset of Hom(Zd,G). Then there exists M such that for anyp1, . . . , pd≥M there exists π∈U such that π(ei)has order p ifor all i.We now proceed to show that the hypothesis of Proposition 8.1 is satisfied if Γis a countable, torsion-free, abelian group and G=Iso(U). Let Ube a non-emptyopen subset of Hom (Γ,G), let δ∈Γand γ∈Γ\{1}, and assume without loss ofgenerality that there exist a finite A⊆U,ǫ>0,π0∈Hom(Γ,G)and e1, . . . , ek∈Γsuch thatπ∈U⇐⇒ ∀ a∈A d/parenleftbigπ(ei)(a),π0(ei)(a)/parenrightbig<ǫ.As above, we also assume that e1, . . . , ekare independent, that δ,γ∈∆=/a\}bracketle{te1, . . . , ek/a\}bracketri}htand that γ=es11···eskkwith si/\e}atio\slash=0 for all i. Applying Theorem 8.6, we can finddistinct prime numbers p1, . . . , pksuch that min pi>max siand, letting ∆′denoteZ(p1)×···× Z(pk)and q:∆→∆′the natural quotient homomorphism, an action∆′/archrightdownψUsuch that∀a∈A∀i≤k d/parenleftbigψ◦q(ei)(a),π0(ei)(a)/parenrightbig<ǫ.Note that, since q(γ)is a generator of ∆′, one has that ψ◦q(δ)∈ /a\}bracketle{tψ◦q(γ)/a\}bracketri}ht. Now,B=ψ(∆′)·Ais finite; applying Lemma 6.1, we can extend ψ◦q:∆/archrightdownBto ̃ψ:Γ/archrightdownX, where Xis a countable metric space, and the construction ensuresthat we still have  ̃ψ(δ)∈ /a\}bracketle{t ̃ψ(γ)/a\}bracketri}ht. Use the Katˇ etov construction to extend  ̃ψto anisometric action, still denoted  ̃ψ, ofΓonU. We still have  ̃ψ(δ)∈ /a\}bracketle{t ̃ψ(γ)/a\}bracketri}htand, usingthe homogeneity of U, we may assume that∀a∈A∀i≤k ̃ψ(ei)(a) =ψ◦q(ei)(a).Hence  ̃ψ∈U, and we are done. /square8.2. Applications. In this subsection, we derive some consequences of Theorem 8 .2.To that end, we need a generalization of the classical Kurato wski–Ulam theorem,which we discuss in Appendix A. For the moment, let us simply s tate the defi-nition of a category-preserving map, which we use below: a co ntinuous map be-tween Polish spaces f:X→Yiscategory-preserving iff−1(A)is comeager in Xwhenever Ais comeager in Y; equivalently, fis category-preserving if it is con-tinuous and f−1(A)is dense whenever Ais open and dense in Y. A coordinateprojection from X×XtoXis an example of a category-preserving map, as is anyopen map; the Kuratowski–Ulam theorem, usually stated for p rojections, extendsto all category-preserving maps (see Theorem A.5).Category-preserving maps have already been considered in t he ergodic theoryliterature: first by King [K3] and later by Ageev [A1], Tikhon ov [T], and Stepin–Eremenko [SE]. The definition used in these papers is differe nt from ours butequivalent to it (see [M], where this matter is discussed in s ome detail).The following lemma provides, in a rather special situation , a simple criterionfor the restriction of homomorphisms to be a category-prese rving map.Lemma 8.7. Let G be a Polish group and Γa countable, abelian group. Assume thatfor a dense set of π∈Hom(Γ×Z,G),π(Γ×Z) = π(Γ). Then the restrictionRes: Hom (Γ×Z,G)→Hom(Γ,G)is category-preserving.GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 21Proof. LetAbe a dense subset of Hom (Γ,G); we will show that Res−1(A)is densein Hom(Γ×Z,G). Let Obe an open, non-empty subset of Hom (Γ×Z,G); we canassume that it is of the formO={π∈Hom(Γ×Z,G): Res(π)∈Uand π(g)∈V},where g∈Γ×Zis a generator of Z,Uis an open subset of Hom (Γ,G), and Vis an open subset of G. Let π0∈Obe such that π0(Γ×Z) = π0(Γ). Then thereexists γ0∈Γwith π0(γ0)∈V. By shrinking Uif necessary, we can assume thatψ∈U=⇒ψ(γ0)∈V. Let now ψ∈U∩Abe arbitrary and define π:Γ×Z→Gbyπ(γ,n) =ψ(γ)ψ(γ0)n. Then clearly Res (π)∈Aand π∈O. /squareFor the next results, we see Zembedded in Zdas the subgroup generated by e1.Theorem 8.8. Let G be either Aut(μ)orIso(U). Then the restriction mapRes : Hom (Zd,G)→Hom(Z,G)is category-preserving.Proof. Since the composition of category-preserving maps is categ ory-preserving,the theorem follows from applying Theorem 8.2 and Lemma 8.7 t o the sequenceof restriction mapsHom(Zd,G)→Hom(Zd−1,G)→ ··· → Hom(Z,G). /squareRemark. After this paper had been written, we found out that Theorem 8 .8 (in thecase of Aut (μ)) also appears as Teorema 1 in Tikhonov [T]. His proof is somew hatdifferent from ours and relies on King’s theorem about the ge neric existence ofsquare roots. A more general result was also obtained by Agee v roughly at thesame time; see Subsection 8.3 below.Corollary 8.9. Let G be either Aut(μ)orIso(U). Let P be a property of abelian Polishgroups such that the set{π∈Hom(Z,G):π(Z)has property P }has the Baire property. Then the following are equivalent fo r any positive integer d:(i)for the generic π∈Hom(Z,G),π(Z)has property P;(ii)for the generic π∈Hom(Zd,G),π(Zd)has property P.Proof. (i)⇒(ii). Let Abe the set of π∈Hom(Z,G)such that π(Z)has P. LetRes: Hom (Zd,G)→Hom(/a\}bracketle{te1/a\}bracketri}ht,G)be the restriction map. We have by Theo-rem 8.8 that Res−1(A)is comeager in Hom (Zd,G), and Theorem 8.2 shows thatB={π∈Hom(Zd,G):π(Zd) = π(/a\}bracketle{te1/a\}bracketri}ht)}is comeager. Then for any π∈Res−1(A)∩B, we have that π(Zd)has property P.(ii)⇒(i). Both Aut (μ)and Iso(U)have a dense conjugacy class (for Aut (μ), thisis a classical result of Rokhlin and for Iso (U), it is due to Kechris–Rosendal [KR])and therefore if Pis not generic in Hom (Z,G), its negation is, and we can applythe above argument to the negation of P. /squareForeman and Weiss [FW] have shown that conjugacy classes are meager inHom(Γ, Aut(μ))for any amenable group Γ. We prove a result in that direction forIso(U), generalizing the result of Kechris stating that conjugacy classes in Iso (U)are meager.22 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVTheorem 8.10. LetΓbe a non-trivial, torsion-free, countable, abelian group. Then con-jugacy classes in Hom(Γ, Iso(U))are meager.Proof. We use Rosendal’s technique [R1] of considering topologica l similarity classes.For the remainder of the proof, fix γ∈Γ\{1}.LetSbe an infinite subset of N. We first claim that{π∈Hom(Γ,G):∃n∈Sπ(γn) =1}is dense in Hom (Γ, Iso(U)). To see this, pick a non-empty open subset U. There ex-ists a finitely generated subgroup ∆∼=Zdcontaining γand a non-empty open V⊆Hom(∆, Iso(U))such that, denoting by Res the restriction map from Hom (Γ, Iso(U))to Hom(∆, Iso(U)), one has{π∈Hom(Γ, Iso(U)): Res(π)∈V} ⊆ U.Letγ1, . . . , γdbe generators of ∆. Applying Theorem 8.6 to ∆, and using the factthat Sis infinite, we can find π∈Hom(∆, Iso(U))and n∈Ssuch that π(γni) =1for all i∈ {1, . . . , d}(hence also π(γn) = 1). Let ∆′=∏di=1Z(n); embed ∆′inTdand let q:∆→Tdthe natural morphism, which we may extend to a morphism(still denoted by q) from ΓtoTd.We can now find a finite A⊆Uand an action q(∆)/archrightdownπAsuch that, for anyaction q(Γ)/archrightdownφUextending q(∆)/archrightdownπA, one has φ◦q∈U. Applying Lemma 6.1toq(∆)≤q(Γ), using Katˇ etov’s construction and the homogeneity of U, we obtainsuch an action φ, and then φ◦q∈Uand φ◦q(γn) =1. This proves the claim.Now, let Vbe a non-empty open subset of Iso (U)containing 1 and San infinitesubset of N. It is clear that{π∈Hom(Γ, Iso(U)):∃n∈Sπ(γn)∈V}is open, and the claim implies that it is dense. It follows tha t, for any infiniteS⊆N, the setAS={π:∃(sn)∈SN:π(γsn)→1}is comeager. This set is conjugacy-invariant, hence if some πhad a comeagerconjugacy class, πwould belong to ASfor all S, which would imply that π(γn)converges to 1. This is only possible if π(γ) = 1; since this is true for all γ∈Γ\{1},πis trivial and we obtain a contradiction. /squareWe finally turn to studying centralizers of generic represen tations. Recall thatC(π)denotes the centralizer of π.Theorem 8.11. Let G be either Aut(μ)orIso(U)and Γbe a countable, non-trivial,torsion-free, abelian group. Then for the generic π∈Hom(Γ,G),C(π) =π(Γ).Proof. Denote by Res: Hom (Γ×Z,G)→Hom(Γ,G)the restriction map and notethat for any π∈Hom(Γ,G), we can naturally identify C(π)with Res−1({π}). ByTheorem 8.2,∀∗ψ∈Hom(Γ×Z,G)ψ(Γ×Z) = ψ(Γ).Applying Lemma 8.7 and Theorem A.5 to Res, we obtain∀∗π∈Hom(Γ,G)∀∗g∈ C(π)g∈π(Γ).Asπ(Γ)is a closed subgroup in C(π), this implies the conclusion. /squareGENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 23Remark. In the case Γ=Zand G=Aut(μ), Theorem 8.11 is due to Chacon–Sxhwartzbauer [CS]. The proof presented here is different a nd self-contained.Remark. As pointed out by S. Solecki, the methods of this section, tog ether withTheorem A.5, can be used to prove Lemma 3 in [S2]. Solecki’s le mma, however,had been obtained prior to our work.8.3. Improvements in the case of Aut(μ).Using some additional theory, it ispossible to extend, in the ergodic-theoretic case, the resu lts of the previous sub-section to more general abelian groups. The following resul t of Ageev general-izes the theorem of King [K3] that the restriction map Res: Ho m(Z, Aut(μ))→Hom(nZ, Aut(μ))is category-preserving.Theorem 8.12 (Ageev [A2]) .Let∆≤Γbe countable abelian groups such that ∆is infi-nite cyclic. Then Res: Hom (Γ, Aut(μ))→Hom(∆, Aut(μ))is category-preserving.This theorem is stated in [A2] without a proof. Its formulati on there is slightlydifferent from ours but using the fact that the action of Aut (μ)on the set of freeactions of Γis minimal (see, e.g., [FW]) and applying Proposition A.7, i t is easy toderive the conclusion above.In a subsequent work [M], the first author has extended Theore m 8.12 by prov-ing that the restriction map from Hom (Γ, Aut(μ))to Hom(∆, Aut(μ))is category-preserving whenever Γis countable abelian and ∆≤Γis finitely generated.Using Theorem 8.12, one can generalize Theorem 8.11 as follo ws.Theorem 8.13. LetΓbe a countable abelian group containing an infinite cyclic su bgroup.Then, for a generic π∈Hom(Γ, Aut(μ)), one hasC(π) =π(Γ).Proof. Let∆≤Γbe an infinite cyclic subgroup; by Ageev’s result, the restri ctionmap π: Hom(Γ, Aut(μ))→Hom(∆, Aut(μ))is category-preserving, so for thegeneric π∈Hom(Γ, Aut(μ)), the centralizer C(π|∆)coincides with π(∆)(thisfollows from the fact that the centralizer of a generic eleme nt is the closure of itspowers, i.e., Theorem 8.11 in the case ∆=Z). SinceC(π)⊆ C(π|∆), we obtain thatC(π)≤π(∆)≤π(Γ)for the generic π. The converse inclusion is obvious. /squareUsing a similar argument, one also sees that for the case G=Aut(μ), Corol-lary 8.9 generalizes from Zdto any abelian group containing an element of infiniteorder.We conclude with several open problems.Questions:(1) Are conjugacy classes in Hom (Γ, Aut(μ))and Hom (Γ, Iso(U))meager forevery countable, infinite group Γ?(2) For Geither Aut (μ)or Iso(U), does there exist a Polish group Hsuch thatfor the generic π∈Hom(Z,G),π(Z)∼=H? In particular, is this true forH=L0(T)?(3) For which pairs of groups ∆≤Γis the restriction map Res : Hom (Γ,G)→Hom(∆,G)category-preserving (again for both G=Aut(μ)and G=Iso(U))?24 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVAPPENDIX A. A GENERALIZATION OF THE KURATOWSKI –ULAM THEOREMIn this appendix, we establish a generalization of the Kurat owski–Ulam theo-rem (Theorem A.5 below), similar to the disintegration theo rem in measure theory.We believe this theorem to be of some independent interest.Let us begin by pointing out that from the proof of the classic al Kuratowski–Ulam theorem (see for example, [K1, 8K]), one can obtain the f ollowing result.Theorem A.1. Let X, Y be Polish spaces and f :X→Y be a continuous, open map. LetA be a Baire measurable subset of X. Then the following are equ ivalent:(i)A is comeager in X;(ii)∀∗y∈Y A∩f−1({y})is comeager in f−1({y}).Proof. We begin by proving that (i) implies (ii) in the particular ca se when Ais adense open subset of X. It is enough to prove that∀∗y∈Y A∩f−1({y})is dense in f−1({y}).Fix a countable basis {Un}for the topology of X; using Baire’s theorem, the abovestatement is equivalent to saying that∀n∀∗y∈Y/parenleftBigf−1({y})∩Un/\e}atio\slash=∅⇒A∩f−1({y})∩Un/\e}atio\slash=∅/parenrightBig.Fixn<ω. The fact that fis open implies thatCn={y∈Y:f−1({y})∩Un/\e}atio\slash=∅⇒A∩f−1({y})∩Un/\e}atio\slash=∅}isGδ(it is the union of a closed set and an open set), and to show tha t it is comea-ger, we simply need to show that it is dense in Y. To that end, pick a non-emptyopen subset VofY. We may restrict our attention to the case when V⊆f(Un).Then f−1(V)∩Un∩Ais non-empty since Ais dense, and for any x∈f−1(V)∩A∩Unwe have, letting y=f(x), that y∈Vand f−1({y})∩A∩Un/\e}atio\slash=∅. Thisproves that (i) implies (ii) when Ais a dense open subset of X. The general casefollows easily from Baire’s theorem.Now we turn to the proof that (ii) implies (i). We proceed by co ntradiction andassume that Ais a Baire measurable subset of Xthat satisfies condition (ii) but isnot comeager. Using the fact that Ais Baire measurable, we know that there existssome non-empty open subset OofXsuch that A∩Ois meager, whence (using thefact that (i) implies (ii) applied to A∩O)∀∗y∈Y(A∩O)∩f−1({y})is meager in f−1({y}).Since f(O)is non-empty and open in Y, we may apply the above condition and(ii) to pick y∈f(O)such that (A∩O)∩f−1({y})is meager in f−1({y}), andA∩f−1({y})is comeager in f−1({y}). This contradicts Baire’s theorem in theclosed non-empty set f−1({y}), and we are done. /squareDefinition A.2. LetX,Ybe Polish spaces and f:X→Ya continuous map. We saythat fiscategory-preserving iff−1(A)is comeager in Xwhenever Ais comeager inY.The definition above is equivalent to saying that f−1(A)is meager wheneverAis meager, and also to the fact that f−1(O)is dense whenever Ois open anddense in Y. Also, note that the composition of two category-preservin g maps isstill category-preserving.GENERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ABELIAN GROUPS AND EXTREME AMEN ABILITY 25Let us point out the following easy fact.Proposition A.3. Let X ,Y be Polish spaces, and f :X→Y a continuous map. Then thefollowing are equivalent:(i)f is category-preserving;(ii)for any non-empty open subset U of X, f (U)is not meager;(iii) for any non-empty open subset U of X, f (U)is somewhere dense.Proof. Suppose that (i) holds but (ii) does not, and let Ube a non-empty opensubset of Xsuch that f(U)is meager. Then f−1(f(U))contains Uand does notintersect the comeager set f−1(Y\f(U)), a contradiction.It is immediate that (ii) implies (iii). To see that (iii) ⇔(i), observe that (iii) is arephrasing of the condition that f−1(O)is dense whenever Ois open and dense inY. /squareIn particular, any open map between Polish spaces is categor y-preserving.Our aim is to obtain an extension of Theorem A.1 to category-p reserving maps.The following easy lemma is a crucial ingredient.Lemma A.4. Let X ,Y be Polish metric spaces, and f :X→Y be a continuous map. Thenthere exists a dense G δsubset A⊆Y such that f :f−1(A)→A is open. (We allow heref−1(A) =∅.)Proof. Fix a countable basis {Un}n<ωof the topology of X. Since each f(Un)isanalytic, there exists for all nan open On⊆Yand a meager Mn⊆Ysuch thatf(Un)△On=Mn. Then B=Y\(/uniontextn<ωMn)is comeager, and we can find adense Gδsubset AofYwhich is contained in B. We claim that this Asatisfiesthe conclusion of the lemma. To see this, note first that for an yn, we have thatf(Un)∩Ais open in A. From this, it follows that f(U)∩Ais open in Afor anyopen subset UofXand we are done. /squareWe are now ready to prove the following strengthening of Theo rem A.1.Theorem A.5. Let X ,Y be Polish spaces and f :X→Y be a continuous, category-preserving map. Let Ωbe a Baire measurable subset of X. Then the following are equi va-lent:(i)Ωis comeager in X;(ii)∀∗y∈YΩ∩f−1({y})is comeager in f−1({y}).Proof. From Lemma A.4 we obtain a dense Gδsubset AofYsuch that f:f−1(A)→Ais open. Since AisGδand fis continuous, B=f−1(A)isGδinX, and it is densesince fis category-preserving.Assume that (i) holds. Since Ωis comeager in Xand Bis dense Gδ, it followsfrom Baire’s theorem that Ω∩Bis comeager in B. Then we may apply Theo-rem A.1 to the open map f:B→Ato obtain that∀∗y∈Y(Ω∩B)∩f−1({y})is comeager in f−1({y}),which implies the desired conclusion.Now assume that (ii) holds. As Ais comeager in Y, we have∀∗a∈AΩ∩f−1({a})is comeager in f−1({a}).Then Theorem A.1 yields that Ω∩Bis comeager in B, and this implies that Ωiscomeager in X. /square26 JULIEN MELLERAY AND TODOR TSANKOVIt may be worth pointing out that Theorem A.5 is best possible in the sense that,iff:X→Yis a continuous map between two Polish spaces such that (i) an d (ii)are equivalent for any Baire measurable subset ΩofX, then fmust be category-preserving.It is particularly interesting, given a Polish group Gand two Polish G-spacesXand Y, to obtain conditions that imply that a G-map π:X→Yis category-preserving. An easy example of such a condition is the follow ing.Proposition A.6. Let G be a Polish group and X ,Y be two Polish G-spaces. LetA={y∈Y:G·y is not meager }andπ:X→Y be a continuous G-map such that π−1(A)is dense in X. Then πiscategory-preserving.Proof. LetUbe a non-empty open subset of X. By assumption, we may pick x∈Usuch that G·π(x)is not meager. Find an open subset VofGsuch that V·x⊆U.Then π(V·x) = V·π(x)is not meager, since a countable union of translates ofV·π(x)covers G·π(x). Hence π(U)is not meager and we are done. /squareThis result applies in particular when there exists y∈Ysuch that G·yis comea-ger and π−1(G·y)is dense in X.Another situation in which we obtain the same conclusion is t he following.Proposition A.7. Let G be a Polish group and X and Y Polish G-spaces such that X isminimal (i.e., every orbit is dense). If π:X→Y is a G-map and π(X)is comeager, thenπis category-preserving.Proof. LetG0be a dense countable subgroup of Gand U⊆Xbe open non-empty.Since the action G/archrightdownXis minimal, we have G0·U=G·U=Xand henceπ(X) = π(G0·U) = G0·π(U)is comeager in Y, hence π(U)is non-meager andπis therefore category-preserving. /square
