arXiv:0704.1634v1  [math-ph]  12 Apr 2007RIGGINGS OF LOCALLY COMPACTABELIAN GROUPS.M. Gadella, F. G ́ omez, S. Wickramasekara.AbstractWe obtain a set of generalized eigenvectors that provides a gen-eralized spectral decomposition for a given unitary representatio n ofa commutative, locally compact topological group. These generalize deigenvectors are functionals belonging to the dual space of a riggin g onthe space of square integrable functions on the character group . Theseriggings are obtained through suitable spectral measure spaces.1 IntroductionThe purpose of the present paper is to take a first step towards a generalformalism of unitary representations of groups and semigro ups on riggedHilbert spaces. To begin with, we want to introduce the theor y correspond-ing to Abelian locally compact groups, leaving the more gene ral nonabeliancase as well as semigroups for a later work. We recall that a rigged Hilbertspaceor a rigging of a Hilbert space His a triplet of the formΦ⊂ H ⊂Φ×, (1)whereΦis a locally convex space dense in Hwith a topology stronger thanthat inherited from HandΦ×is the dual space of Φ. In this paper, weshall always assume that His separable.To each self adjoint operator AonH, the von Neumann theorem [1]associates a spectral measure space . This is the quadruple (Λ ,A,H,P),whereHistheHilbertspaceonwhich Aacts, Λ = σ(A) isthespectrumof A,Ais the family of Borel sets in Λ, and Pis the projection valued measure onAdetermined by Athrough the von Neumann theorem. Obviously Λ ⊂R.A complete discussion on the relation between these concept s can be foundin [2]. We say that the topological vector space ( Φ,τΦ) (vector space Φwith1the locally convex topology given by τΦ) equips or rigs the spectral measure(Λ,A,H,P) if the following conditions hold:i. There exists a one-to-one linear mapping I:Φ/mapsto−→ Hwith rangedense in H. We can assume that Φ⊂ His a dense subspace of HandI, the canonical injection from ΦintoH.ii. There exists a σ-finite measure μon (Λ,A), a set Λ 0⊂Λ with zero μmeasure and a family of vectors in Φ×of the form{|λk×/a\}bracketri}ht ∈Φ×:λ∈Λ\Λ0, k∈ {1,2,...,m}}, (2)wherem∈ {∞,1,2,...}, such that(φ,P(E)φ)H=/integraldisplayEm/summationdisplayk=1/a\}bracketle{tφ|λk×/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketle{tφ|λk×/a\}bracketri}ht∗dμ(λ),∀φ,φ∈Φ,∀E∈ A.(3)Each family of the form (2) satisfying (3) is called a complete system ofDirac kets of the spectral measure (Λ ,A,H,P) in (Φ,τΦ). In this case, thetripletΦ⊂ H ⊂Φ×is a rigged Hilbert space, which is called a riggingof(Λ,A,H,P).Conversely, the von Neumann theorem asserts that a projecti on valuedmeasure defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets on a subset of the real linedetermines a self adjoint operator A. If (Λ,A,H,P), where Λ ⊂R, is such ameasure space, then for φandφon a suitable dense domain, the self-adjointoperator Asuch that Λ = σ(A) is defined by(φ,Aφ)H=/integraldisplayΛm/summationdisplayk=1λ/a\}bracketle{tφ|λk×/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketle{tφ|λk×/a\}bracketri}ht∗dμ(λ) (4)whereμ,|λk×/a\}bracketri}htandmare as defined in (3). Further, if f(λ) is a measurablecomplex valued function on Λ, then, for φ,φon a suitable dense domain,which is the whole of Hiff(λ) is bounded, the operator valued functionf(A) is defined by(φ,f(A)φ)H=/integraldisplayΛm/summationdisplayk=1f(λ)/a\}bracketle{tφ|λk×/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketle{tφ|λk×/a\}bracketri}ht∗dμ(λ). (5)The functionals |λk×/a\}bracketri}ht ∈Φ×and the complex numbers f(λ) are the gen-eralized eigenvectors and respective generalized eigenva lues off(A) [3]. In2particular, if f(λ) =eitλ, wheret∈R, the set of operators eitAforms a oneparameter commutative group of unitary operators and Φ⊂ H ⊂Φ×asdefined above is a rigging for this group.One can expect that similar riggings exist for unitary repre sentations ofarbitrary groups and semigroups and that the operators of th e representa-tions can be expanded in terms of generalized eigenvectors a nd eigenvaluesas in (5). Riggings that make use of Hardy functions on a half p lane existfor one parameter dynamical semigroups e−itH, t≤0 ande−itH, t≥0,whereHis the Hamiltonian [3].In the present paper, we show that riggings along the above li nes al-ways exist for unitary representations of Abelian locally c ompact groups.In particular, let Gbe an Abelian locally compact group and π, a unitaryrepresentation of Gon a separable Hilbert space H. We will see that theFourier transform on G, or equivalently, the Gelfand transformation on theC∗-algebra L1(G) allows us to represent πin terms of generalized eigenfunc-tionsand riggings of Hin a manner similar to the description given in [2]for the action of a spectral measure.2 Characters of Abelian Locally Compact Groups.LetGbe a locally compact abelian group with Haar measure μ. A characterχofGis any continuous mapping from Ginto the set of complex numbersCsuch that χ(g1g2) =χ(g1)χ(g2) for all g1,g2∈Gand|χ(g)|= 1 for allg∈G, i.e., a character of Gis a continuous homomorphism from Ginto theunit circle T. The set of all the characters of Gforms a group, /hatwideG, which isoften called the dual group of G. We shall use the notation χ(g) :=/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}ht.LetL1(G) be the space of complex valued functions, integrable in themodulus with respect to the Haar measure μonG.L1(G) is an abelian ∗-algebra, with the convolution product. The dual group /hatwideGcan be identifiedwiththeset of maximal ideals of L1(G) [4]. Whenendowed withtheGelfandtopology, /hatwideGis a compact Hausdorf space (see [5] page 268).For anyχ∈/hatwideG, we may define a linear functional Λ χonL1(G) byΛχ(f) =/integraldisplay/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}ht∗f(g)dμ(g). (6)LetC(/hatwideG) be the space of complex continuous functions on /hatwideGwith thesupremun norm topology. The Gelfand-Fourier transform is t he mappingF:L1(G)/mapsto−→C(/hatwideG) defined by:[Ff](χ) =/hatwidef(χ) = Λχ(f) =/integraldisplay/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}ht∗f(g)dμ(g). (7)3Let (π,H) be a unitary representation of G. Then (see [6] page 105),there is a unique spectral measure ( /hatwideG,B,H,P), where Bis theσ-algebra ofBorel sets on /hatwideG, such that for all g∈Gand allf∈L1(G), we haveπ(g) =/integraldisplaybG/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}htdP(χ) ; π(f) =/integraldisplaybGΛχ(f)dP(χ).(8)There is a one to one correspondence between unitary represe ntations of Gand non degenerate ∗-representations1ofL1(G) as given by (7) and (8).2.1 Riggings of functions of characters.Let us consider the spectral measure space ( /hatwideG,B,H,P) introduced in theprevious section. For simplicity in the discussion, we assu me the existenceof a cyclic vector u∈ H. This means that the subspace spanned by thevectors of the form P(E)uwithE∈ Ais dense in H. The general case canbe easily obtained as a finite or countable direct sum of cycli c subspaces ofH.Then, the von Neumann decomposition theorem [1] establishe s that be-ing given the spectral measure space ( /hatwideG,B,H,P) and a positive measureνon (/hatwideG,B) with maximal spectral type2[P] (ν∈[P]), there exists a uni-tary mapping U:H /mapsto−→L2(/hatwideG,dμ),such that πν(g) :=Uπ(g)U−1is themultiplication by /a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}htonL2(/hatwideG,dν):πν(g)φ(χ) =Uπ(g)U−1φ(χ) =/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}htφ(χ),∀φ(χ)∈L2(/hatwideG,dν).(9)Sinceπν(g) is a multiplication operator, it is easy to see that the Dira cdelta type Radon measures λ(χ)δχform a complete system of Dirac kets forthe spectral measure space ( /hatwideG,B,H,P) in the sense given by (3). For anyf(χ)∈Φthese deltas satisfy/integraldisplaybGf(χ)δχ′dν=f(χ′). (10)Thus, a possible choice for ΦisC(/hatwideG), the space of continuous functionson/hatwideGendowed with a topology τΦstronger than both the topologies of thesupremun and the ||·||L2(bG,dν)norm. In this case, the dual Φ×ofΦincludesthe space of all Radon measures on ( /hatwideG,B). We have the rigged Hilbert spaceΦ⊂L2(/hatwideG)⊂Φ×.1Non degenerate means that π(f)v=0for every fimpliesv=0. The representationhas also the property that π(f∗) =π†(f), where f/mapsto→f∗is the involution on L1(G), see[6].2For a definition and properties of the spectral type, see [1, 2 ].43 Positive Type Functions and Riggings.Next, we shall introduce another representation πφofGlinked to a functionof positive type, that can be defined as follows: Let φ(g)∈L∞(G). We saythatφ(g) is a function of positive type if for any f(g)∈L1(G), we have that/integraldisplayG/integraldisplayGf∗(g)f(gg′)φ(g′)dμ(g)dμ(g′)≥0, (11)where the star ∗denotes complex conjugation.Ifφ(g) is a function of positive type, then, the following positiv e Hermi-tian form on L1(G)/a\}bracketle{th|f/a\}bracketri}htφ:=/integraldisplayG/integraldisplayGh∗(g′)f(g)φ(g−1g′)dμ(g′)dμ(g) (12)is semi-definite in the sense that it may exist non-zero funct ionsf∈L1(G)such that /a\}bracketle{tf|f/a\}bracketri}htφ= 0. These functions form a subspace of L1(G) that wedenote by N. Consider the factor space L1(G)/Nand again denote by /a\}bracketle{t·|·/a\}bracketri}htφthe scalar product induced on L1(G)/Nby the Hermitian form (12). Thecompletion of L1(G)/Nby/a\}bracketle{t·|·/a\}bracketri}htφgives a Hilbert space usually denoted asHφ. Then, for any g∈Gandf(g)∈L1(G), we define:(Lg)f(g′) :=f(g−1g′). (13)Note that Lgpreserves the scalar product /a\}bracketle{t·|·/a\}bracketri}htφ:/a\}bracketle{tLgh|Lgf/a\}bracketri}htφ=/integraldisplayG/integraldisplayGh∗(g−1g′)f(g−1g′′)φ(g′−1g′′)dμ(g′)dμ(g′′)=/integraldisplayG/integraldisplayGh∗(g′)f(g′′)φ((gg′)−1(gg′′))dμ(g′)dμ(g′′) =/a\}bracketle{th|f/a\}bracketri}htφ,(14)for allf(g)∈L1(G). This also shows that LgN ⊂ N and therefore Lginduces a transformation on the factor space L1(G)/N, that we also denoteasLg, defined asLg(f(g′)+N) :=f(g−1g′)+N=Lg(f(g′))+N. (15)By (14), we easily see that Lgpreserves the scalar product on L1(G)/N. Itis obviously invertible. Therefore, it can beuniquely exte nded into a unitaryoperator on Hφ. Then, if for each g∈Gwe writeπφ(g)f:=Lgf ,∀f∈ Hφ, (16)5then,πφ(g) determines a unitary representation of GonHφ. The proof ofthis statement is straightforward.The representation πφ(g) ofGonHφcan be lifted to a unitary repre-sentation of the group algebra L1(G) onHφthat we shall also denote as πφ.In this case, for all f∈L1(G), we have πφ(f)h:=f∗h. Here,∗denotesconvolution.Theexistenceofacyclicvector η∈ Hφfortherepresentation πφisprovenin [6]. Recall that ηis cyclic vector if the subspace {πφ(f)η,∃f∈L1(G)}is dense in Hφ. In addition, this result also gives the following formula t hatallows to find the function φ(g) in terms of ηand the unitary representationπφofGonHφ:φ(g) =/a\}bracketle{tη|πφ(g)η/a\}bracketri}ht. (17)Now, let us consider the unitary πνrepresentation of Ggiven by (9) withcyclic vector ξand define the following complex valued function on G:φ(g−1g′) :=/a\}bracketle{tξ|πν(g−1g′)ξ/a\}bracketri}htL2(bG,dν)=/a\}bracketle{tπν(g)ξ|πν(g′)ξ/a\}bracketri}htL2(bG,dν).(18)Then, as shown in [6], Chapter 3,i.) the function φis of positive type in the sense of (11), andii.) therepresentationof GonHφgivenby πφ, whereφisas(18)isequivalenttoπν.Note that this result implies in particular that for this φas in (18)φ(g) =/a\}bracketle{tη|πφ(g)η/a\}bracketri}htφ=/a\}bracketle{tξ|πν(g)ξ/a\}bracketri}htL2(bG,dν),∀g∈G. (19)According to (9) and (18), we have thatφ(g−1g′) =/a\}bracketle{tπν(g)ξ|πν(g′)ξ/a\}bracketri}htL2(bG,dν)=/integraldisplaybG[/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}htξ(χ)]∗/a\}bracketle{tg′|χ/a\}bracketri}htξ(χ)dν(χ).(20)Ifwecarry thisformulainto(12)andapplytheFubinitheore m of thechangeof the order of integration, we have for all f,h∈L1(G):/a\}bracketle{tf|h/a\}bracketri}htφ=/integraldisplaybG/parenleftbigg/integraldisplayG[f(g)/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}ht]∗dμ(g)/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg/integraldisplayGh(g′)/a\}bracketle{tg′|χ/a\}bracketri}htdμ(g′)/parenrightbigg|ξ(χ)|2dν(χ)=/integraldisplaybG[/hatwidef(χ)]∗/hatwideh(χ)|ξ(χ)|2dν(χ) =/integraldisplaybG/a\}bracketle{t/hatwidef|χ/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketle{tχ|/hatwideh/a\}bracketri}ht|ξ(χ)|2dν(χ).(21)This latter formula shows that the generalized eigenvalues Fχofπφ(g) arethe following: if f∈Φ:=L1(G)∩L2(G)6|Fχ/a\}bracketri}ht ≡Fχ:f/mapsto−→ |η(χ)|/hatwidef∗(χ) =|η(χ)|/integraldisplayG/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}htf∗(g)dμ(g).(22)We endow Φwith any topology stronger than the topologies L1(G) andL2(G). For instance, we can choose a locally convex topology with the semi-normsp1(f) :=||f||L1(G)andp2(f) :=||f||L2(G), for allf∈Φ. With thistopology or another stronger one, the antilinear functiona lFχis continuous.Then, if we use (8) in the scalar product on Hφ, we have:/a\}bracketle{tf|πφ(g)h/a\}bracketri}htφ=/integraldisplaybG/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}htd/a\}bracketle{tf|P(χ)h/a\}bracketri}htφ=/integraldisplaybG/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}ht|η(χ)|2/hatwidef∗(χ)/hatwideg(χ)dν(χ)=/integraldisplaybG/a\}bracketle{tg|χ/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketle{tf|Fχ/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketle{tFχ|h/a\}bracketri}htdν(χ).(23)If we omit the arbitrary f,h∈Φin (23), we have the following spectraldecomposition for πφ(g) for allg∈G:πφ(g) =/integraldisplaybG/a\}bracketle{tχ|g/a\}bracketri}ht|Fχ/a\}bracketri}ht/a\}bracketle{tFχ|dν(χ). (24)Note that in the antidual space Φ×, the generalized eigenvalue equationπφ(g)|Fχ/a\}bracketri}ht=/a\}bracketle{tχ|g/a\}bracketri}ht|Fχ/a\}bracketri}htis valid, where we use the same notation πφ(g) forthe extensions of these unitary operators into Φ×.Inconclusion, foreachunitaryrepresentationofalocally compactAbeliantopological group, we have found an equivalent representat ion and a riggedHilbert space such that each of the unitary operators of the r epresentationadmits a generalized spectral decomposition in terms of gen eralized eigen-vectors of them. The eigenvectors of the decomposition are l abeled by thegroup characters only and their respective eigenvalues, co mplex numberswith modulus one, depend on both the corresponding characte r and thegroup element. The spectral decomposition and the correspo nding riggingcomes after the existence of a spectral measure space.Note that the Abelian property is crucial in our derivation a nd in partic-ular in the existence of the spectral measure space ( /hatwideG,B,H,P), since then,the group algebra is also Abelian and the Gelfand theory appl ies. An ex-tension of the present formalism to nonabelian locally comp act groups willrequire an extension of the Gelfand formalism that at least a llows for a newand consistent definition of the Gelfand Fourier transform ( 7), an essentialfeature of our construction.7AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the financial support from the Junta de Castil la y Le ́ onProject VA013C05 and the Ministry of Education and Science o f Spain,projects MTM2005-09183 and FIS2005-03988.
