LetSbe acountable, abeliansemigroupofcontinuoussurjections on a compact metric space X. Corresponding to thisdynamical system we associate two operator algebras, the tenso ralgebra, and the semicrossed product. There is a unique smallestC∗-algebra into which an operator algebra is completely isometri-cally embedded, which is the C∗-envelope. The C∗-envelope of thetensor algebra is a crossed product C∗-algebra. We also study twonatural classes of representations, the left regular represent ationsand the orbit representations. The first is Shilov, and the secondhas a Shilov resolution.1.INTRODUCTIONLetXbe a compact metric space, and San abelian semigroup andletσbe a map of Sinto the set of continuous, surjective maps ofX→X, which we assume to be a semigroup isomorphism. From thisdynamical system ( X,σ,S) we construct two operator algebras: thetensor algebra, and the semicrossed product.If the semigroup Sis a group, then the tensor algebra and the semi-crossed product coincide with the crossed product, C(X)⋊σS.Ourinterest is in dealing with noninvertible dynamics, so we will assumethat the semigroup Sis not a group.Work on such problems began with single-variable dynamics [1], [16]and many others. Work with multivariate dynamics is more recent.This paper is in a sense a counterpoint to the important contributionof Davidson and Katsoulis [5], in which they studied various operatoralgebras that could be considered multivariate analogues of the (sin glevariable) semicrossed product, and developed the dilation theory a ndisomorphism properties of these algebras.

In [6], Donsig, Katavolos and Manoussos give a precise de-scription of the Jacobson radical of semicrossed products, wher e thesemigroup is Zd+.While the point of view of C∗-dynamical systems mostly deals withgroupactionsonC∗-algebras,Exel[7]andExelandRenault[8]considernoninvertible dynamical systems, such as local homeomorphisms on acompact space. There is the additional feature of the transfer o perator,whichisnotpresent here. Nevertheless itisinterestingtocompare theirapproach to the C∗-algebra which arises naturally in our context as theC∗-envelope of the tensor algebra.We begin by constructing an algebra A0which contains operatorsSsforsan element of the semigroup S, and functions f∈C(X),thecontinuous complex valued functions on X, subject to the covarianceconditionf Ss=Ssf◦σs.An element of the algebra A0has the form/summationtextsSsfx,where the sum isfinite. We study classes of representations of this algebra. One na turalclass of representations arises from the left regular representa tion onthe Hilbert space l2(S) and the evaluation map of functions at a pointx∈X.These representations, denoted by π, represent the operators Ssasisometries, andthey separate the points of A0.Completing A0in thenorm determined by these representations yields an algebra A(X,S)which we call the left regular algebra.Another class of representations we study we call orbit represen ta-tions. These are similar to the representations π, except they act onthe orbit of a point x∈X.We denote the orbit representations by ρ.While orbit representations have been studied in the context of gro upactions, the semigroup setting presents features not present w hen deal-ing with goup actions. We show these representations are associat edwith cocycles, and indeed there is a one-to-onecorrespondence b etweenthe orbit representations and the orbit cocycles.We have defined two nonselfadjoint operator algebras arising fromthedynamicalsystem ( X,σ,S).Oneisthetensor algebra, alreadymen-tioned. The other is the semicrossed product. This is the completionof theA0in the norm arising from considering all isometric covariantrepresentations (Definition 2). However we have no tools to chara c-terize all such representations, so there is little we can say about s uchalgebras.Davidson and Katsoulis [5] use the general approach of Katsura [11 ]and Muhly and Solel [13] to obtain the tensor algebra and its C∗-envelope via C∗-correspondences. Our approach to the C∗-envelope,SEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 3done in[17] for the single variable setting, yields a moretangible result ,yet is only available in a restricted context.While the enveloping group Gcontaining the semigroup S,is easilyobtained as G=S −S,there need not be any connection between theabstract group Gand mappings on the compact metric space X. Insection 5 we construct a compact metric space /tildewideXon which the groupGacts by homeomorphisms /tildewideσg(g∈ G) and a continuous surjectionp:/tildewideX→Xwhich “intertwines” this group action with the originalsemigroup action. Theorem 2 shows that the C∗-envelope of the tensoralgebraA(X,S) is identified with the C∗-crossed product C(/tildewideX)⋊/tildewideσG.The description of the C∗-envelope in Theorem 2 also yields some in-formationabout theleft regular representations πandthe(left regular)orbit representations ρ. We are able to show that the representations πare Shilov, and that the left regular orbit representations have a S hilovresolution.We should comment on the relation of our results with those of [5].They consider actions of the free semigroup on n-generators (for fixedn∈N), whereas the semigroups we consider are abelian. Even thoughwe do not deal with specific examples of dynamical systems in this pa-per, it is also worth noting that there are actions which fall within ourcontext which are not homomorphic images of free finitely generate dsemigroups: in [18], Example 5, there is an action of the semigroup ofnon-negative dyadic rationals on a compact metric space Xby localhomeomorphisms. We should also note that there is relatively littleoverlap of our results with [5]. Because Davidson and Katsoulis dealwith finitely many coordinates, they are able to obtain a number ofdilation results. However the example of Parrott [14] of three comm ut-ing contractions which do not admit a unitary dilation illustrates theinherent difficulty of a general dilation theory in our setting. Whatwe are able to achieve, is a dilation of the commuting contractionsρ(Ss) (s∈ S) to unitaries. While there are a number of positive resultsin the literature, such as the dilation results for n−tuples of doublycommuting contractions, we are not aware that our dilation theoryoverlaps with other such results.Since this paper was written, we were given a preprint of Davidson,Fuller and Kakariadis ([3]) in which they obtain another proof of ourtheorem 2.2.BACKGROUND AND NOTATIONStanding Hypothesis Throughout the paper, Swill denote anabelian semigroup with cancellation, and identity element, denoted by4 DUNCAN AND PETERS0. The semigroup operation will be written as addition. The intersec-tion of all abelian groups which contain Swill be written as G=S−S.Some of the constructions, such as the left regular representat ionπx,and the orbit reprsentation ρx,do not require the commutativity of thesemigroup. The tools we employ, such as integrating over the compa ctdual group Γ of the group G=S −S,do use commutativity. For thatreason, we assume commutativity of Sthroughout the paper.We assume that Sacts on a compact metric space. Thus, there isa homomorphism, denoted by σ, fromSinto the semigroup of con-tinuous, surjective maps of X→X.There is no loss of generality byassuming that σis a semigroup isomorphism (onto its image), whichwe will do. Furthermore, we assume that Sis not a group, for oth-erwise nothing new is achieved. However, it may be the case that Scontains a nontrivial group S ∩−S.The triple ( X,σ,S) will be calleda dynamical system.We will not keep repeating these assumptions in the statements ofour results.3.SEMICROSSED PRODUCTSLetA0be the algebra generated by C(X) together with symbolsSs, s∈ Sand subject to the relationsfSs=Ssf◦σs, s∈ S, f∈C(X)Ss+t=SsSt, s,t∈ S(†)Thus a typical element of the algebra has the form/summationdisplays∈SSsfswhere the sum is finite.Let Γ be the dual group of G.Definition 1. Define the Gauge automorphism τγ(γ∈Γ) onA0byτγ(/summationdisplaysSsfs) =/summationdisplays/an}bracketle{tγ,s/an}bracketri}htSsfs.Define the projections Ps, s∈ S: forF∈ A0,Ps(F) =/integraldisplayΓτγ(F)/an}bracketle{t−γ,s/an}bracketri}htdγwheredγis Haar measure on the compact group Γ .Note we are con-sidering the semigroup Sand the group Gas discrete groups, and so Γis a compact abelian group.SEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 5Note that if F=/summationtextsSsfs∈ A0,thenPs0(F) is equal to either Ss0fs0or 0 ifs0is not in the sum.Definition 2. We say that a representationπ:A0→ B(H)with the following properties:(1)π(Ss) is an isometry (resp., a contraction) in B(H) for alls∈ S;(2)π(S0) =I;(3)π|C(X)is a C∗-representation.is an isometric (resp., a contractive) covariant representation of thepair (C(X),S).Observe that C(X) is embedded in A0by the map f/mapsto→S0f.In [5] Davidson and Katsoulis consider four sets of conditions on rep -resentations. But two of those conditions do not have a direct tra nsla-tion into this general context–namely, row contractive and row iso met-ric, since our semigroup need not be freely generated by finitely man ySs.Definition 3. LetC(X)⋊σSdenote the semicrossed product algebra;that is, the completion of A0with respect to the norm||F||= supπ||π(F)||forF∈ A0, where thesupremum is over all representations πsatisfyingproperties (1) ,(2),(3) of the definition.4.THE LEFT REGULAR ALGEBRAWe now define a class of representations of A0which will play animportant role in what follows.Givenx∈Xandγ∈Γ define a representation πx,γofA0on theHilbert space l2(S) as follows: Let ξs∈l2(S) be given byξs(t) =/braceleftBigg1 ift=s;0 otherwise.It suffices to define πx,γ(f), f∈C(X),andπx,γ(St) on the vectors ξssince linear combinations of such vectors are dense. Setπx,γ(f)ξs=f◦σs(x)ξsandπx,γ(St)ξs=/an}bracketle{tγ,t/an}bracketri}htξt+s.It is a routine calculation to verify that πx,γrespects the relations †.The adjoint is given by6 DUNCAN AND PETERSπx,γ(St)∗ξs=/braceleftBigg/an}bracketle{tγ,t/an}bracketri}htξuifs=t+ufor some u∈ S0 otherwise.so thatπx,γ(St)∗πx,γ(St)ξs=ξsfor alls∈ S,and since the set {ξs:s∈S}is an orthonormal basis for l2(S),it follows πx,γ(St)∗πx,γ(St) =I.It is obvious that πx,γis a∗-representation when restricted to C(X).Thus it is an isometric covariant representation.Remark1.Notice that the unitary given by ξs/mapsto→ /an}bracketle{t−γ,s/an}bracketri}htξsprovides aunitary equivalence between the representation πx,γandπx,0and therepresentations πx,0are the semigroup analogue of the regular repre-sentations of crossed products, coming from the one dimensional eval-uation representations, as in [19, 7.7].Lemma 1. LetF∈ A0, F/ne}ationslash= 0.Thenforsome x∈X, γ∈Γ, πx,γ(F)/ne}ationslash=0.Proof.By the remark it suffices to consider γthe trivial character. WewriteF=/summationtexts∈ISsfswhereIis a finite subset of S,and such thatfs/ne}ationslash= 0 fors∈I.Letu∈ S, s0∈Iand compute/integraldisplayΓπx,γ(F)ξudγ=/summationdisplays∈I/integraldisplayΓπx,γ(Ssfs)ξudγ=/summationdisplays∈I/integraldisplayΓ/an}bracketle{tγ,s/an}bracketri}htfs(σu(x))ξs+udγ=fs0(σu(x))ξs+uWe may choose x∈Xandu∈ Ssuch that fs0(σu(x))/ne}ationslash= 0.Thus, thereis a choice of x∈Xandγ∈Γ for which πx,γ(F)/ne}ationslash= 0. /squareCorollary 1. The class of representations πx,γ,(x,γ)∈X×Γ,sepa-rates the elements of A0.Definition 4. We define the left regular algebra A(S,X) to be thecompletion of A0in the norm of the representation⊕(x,γ)∈X×Γπx,γ.Remark 2.The representations πx,γ,initially defined on the algebraA0,admit a unique extension to the left regular algebra A(S,X).Theextended representations will also be denoted πx,γ.Remark3.In light of remark 1, the norm on A(S,X) could be definedusing the subclass of representations πx,0.SEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 7Notation. We will write πxforπx,0.In other words, if γis the trivialcharacter 0 ,we will omit the 0 .LetF∈ A(S,X),||F||= 1,andsupposethatforall u∈ S, Pu(F) =0.Now there are x∈X,and unit vectors ξ, η∈l2(S) for which|(πx(F)ξ,η)|>12||F||.H Here we are making use of Remark 3, that it is sufficient to considerthe representations πx.Hence there exist s, t∈ Ssuch thatǫ:=|(πx(F)ξs,ξt)|>0.LetG∈ A0be such that ||F−G||< δ, where 0 < δ < ǫ/2.Then|(πx(G)ξs,ξt)| ≥ |(πx(F)ξs,ξt)|−||F−G||≥ǫ−δ> ǫ/2.ExpressG=/summationtextuSufu.Now|(πx(G)ξs,ξt)|>0 implies for u=t−s∈S, fu/ne}ationslash= 0.Thus for u=t−swe havePu(G−F) =Pu(G) =Sufu.Now|(πx(G)ξs,ξt)|=|fu(σs(x))|> ǫ/2,so that||Pu(G)||> ǫ/2.On the other hand,||Pu(G)||=||Pu(F−G)|| ≤ ||F−G||< ǫ/2.We have shown the following:Proposition 1. IfFis a nonzero element of A(S,X)then there existsu∈ Ssuch that Pu(F)/ne}ationslash= 0.4.1.ORBIT REPRESENTATIONS. Next we define another classofrepresentations of A0,whichwecallorbitrepresentations. Fix x∈Xand letS(x) denote the orbit of x,namely,S(x) ={σs(x) :s∈ S}.Definition 5. A function μ:S × S(x)→Cis anorbit cocycle if itsatisfies(1) For each t∈ Sanyy∈ S(x)/summationdisplayσt(yj)=σt(y)|μ(t,yj)|2≤1(2) (cocycle condition) For each s, t∈ S,andy∈ S(x)μ(s+t,y) =μ(t,y)μ(s,σt(y)).Wemayalso write μxto emphasize the dependence onthepoint x∈X.8 DUNCAN AND PETERSWe will define the orbit representations ρx,μof the algebra A0onl2(S(x)).Letξybe the functionξy(w) =/braceleftBigg1,ifw=y0,otherwise.Define, for f∈C(X), y∈ S(x)ρx,μ(f)ξy=f(y)ξyandρx,μ(St)ξy=μ(t,y)ξσt(y).Letξ=/summationtextaiξyjbe a unit vector in l2(S(x)) such that σt(yj) =σt(y)for allj.ρx,μ(St)ξ= (/summationdisplayajμ(t,yj))ξσt(y).Hence||ρx,μ(St)ξ||2=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/summationdisplayajμ(t,yj)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2≤/parenleftBig/summationdisplay|aj|2/parenrightBig/parenleftBig/summationdisplay|μ(t,yj)|2/parenrightBig.Sinceξis a unit vector,/summationtext|aj|2= 1.Hence, if ρx,μ(St) is to be con-tractive, we must have that/summationtext|μ(t,yj)|2≤1.On the other hand, letus note that this condition is sufficient for ρx,μ(St) to be contractive.Consider the dense set of vectors which are linear combinations of v ec-torsξof the above form. Say η=/summationtextbkξk,where for each k, ρx,μ(St)ξkis a multiple of ξukfor some uk∈ S,where the ukare distinct elementsofS,theξkare unit vectors, and/summationtext|bk|2= 1.Then by the above wehave that||ρx,μ(St)η||2=/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/summationdisplayρx,μ(St)bkξk/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2≤/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/summationdisplaybjξuk/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle2≤1Additionally we have, for s, t∈ Sandy∈ S(x)ρx,μ(Ss+t)ξy=ρx,μ(SsSt)ξy=ρx,μ(Ss)ρx,μ(St)ξy=ρx,μ(Ss)μ(t,y)ξσt(y)=μ(t,y)μ(s,σt(y))ξσs+t(y)=μ(s+t,y)ξσs+t(y)SEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 9Toconcludethat ρx,μisarepresentation, weneed ρx,μ(fSs) =ρx,μ(Ssf◦σs), s∈ S, f∈C(X).But that is a routine calculation.We summarize this asCorollary 2. Orbit representations are contractive covariant repre-sentations. Furthermore, there is a one-to-one correspond ence betweenorbit representations and orbit cocycles.Remark 4.Letμbe an orbit cocycle, and γ∈Γ. Then γμis also anorbit cocycle. That is, γμ(t,y) =/an}bracketle{tγ,t/an}bracketri}htμ(t,y).To address the question of what can be said about the existence oforbit cocycles we need a definition from [18].Definition 6. Acocyclefor a dynamical system ( X,σ,S) is a mapω:S ×X→Rsuch that(1)ω(s,x)≥0 for alls∈ S, x∈X;(2) For each y∈X, t∈ S,/summationtextσt(x)=yω(t,x) = 1;(3) For each t∈ S,the map x→ω(t,x) is continuous;(4) For each s, t∈ Sandx∈X, ωsatisfies the cocycle identityω(s+t,x) =ω(s,x)ω(t,σs(x)).If thedynamical system ( X,σ,S) admits acocycle, then given x∈Xone can define an orbit cocycle μxby letting μx(t,y) =/radicalbigω(t,σt(y)),fort∈ Sandyin the orbit of x.Example 1.[18] considers abeliansemigroup actions ona compact met-ric space by continuous, surjective, locallly injective maps. Propos ition2 gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a Zk+actions to admit acocycle, and Example 5 of [18] is an action of the non-negative dyadicrationals on a compact metric space by local homeomorphisms whichadmits a cocycle.4.2.LEFT REGULARORBITREPRESENTATIONS. Wewouldlike to establish the existence of a class of orbit cocycles which we willcallleft regular orbit cocycles . To do this, we need to impose a re-striction on the dynamical system ( X,σ,S).If a point x∈Xhas theproperty that for each yin the orbit of x,{t∈ S:σt(x) =y}is finite,we will say that xhas thefinite stability property . In case Sis a groupG, this is equivalent to saying that the stability subroup Gxis finite.However, in our case, card {t∈ S:σt(x) =y}could depend on thepointy, and indeed, these cardinalities need not be bounded.Example 2.LetZ+=N∪{0}andS={(m,n)∈(Z+)2: 0≤m≤n}.Sis an abelian semigroup under coordinatewise addition. Let X1be a10 DUNCAN AND PETERScopy of−N∪{0},andX2a copy of the integers, both with the discretetopology. These copies are chosen so that X1, X2are disjoint. LetX=X1∪X2∪ {x∞}, with the one point compactification topology.ThenXis metrizable.LetSact onXas follows: x∞will be fixed under all σm,n.Forx∈X1,defineσm,n(x) =/braceleftBiggx+m,ifx+m≤00 otherwiseand forx∈X2,letσm,n(x) =x+n.Then each map σm,nis surjective,and continuous in the one point compactification topology. None is ahomeomorphism, except for σ0,0,the identity.Now ifx∈X2,thenxhas the finite stability property. Indeed, letybe in the orbit of x, soy=x+kfor some non-negative integer k.Thenσt(x) =yifft= (m,k) for some m,0≤m≤k.This is finite foreach such y, but there is no upper bound on the cardinalities.Let us see how the two classes of representations πx,γandρx,μarerelated by constructing a special cocycle μ.Fix a point x∈Xwhich has the finite stability property . Define anequivalence relation ∼on the semigroup Sbys∼tifσs(x) =σt(x),and let [s] denote an equivalence class. Define a map q:S → S(x)byq(s) =σs(x).Thenqis a one-to-one surjective map of the set ofequivalence classes S/∼to the orbit S(x).LetH00be the subspace of all (finite) linear combinations η=/summationtextasξsfor which/summationtextasξq(s)= 0.Note that any such sum is the sum of elements/summationtextasξq(s)for which the sappearing in the sum belong to the sameequivalence class, and the sum of the coefficients/summationtextas= 0.Foryin the orbit of x, letH(y) = span{ξt:σt(x) =y}By the finitestability property of x, this subspace is finite dimensional, hence equalto its closure in l2(S).Thenl2(S) ={⊕y∈S(x)H(y)}−.LetH0(y) =H00∩H(y).This is precisely the codimension one sub-space consisting of all linear combinations/summationtextatξtwhereξt∈ H(y) and/summationtextat= 0.Since the subspace is finite dimensional, it is closed in H(y).Lemma 2. Thelinearspace H00isinvariantunderthe maps πx,γ(f), f∈C(X), and under πx,γ(St), t∈ S.Hence the closure of H00,which wedenote by H0, is invariant under πx,γ(F),forF∈ A0, γ∈Γ.Proof.Letf∈C(X) andη∈ H00. It is enough to show that thesubspace H0(y), y∈ S(x) is mapped to itself under πx,γ(f).So weSEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 11may assume η∈ H0(y), η=/summationtextajξsjwhere/summationtextaj= 0.Thenπx,γ(f)η=/summationdisplayf(σsj(x))ajξsj=/summationdisplayf(y)ajξsj∈ H0(y)Nowπx,γ(St) does not map the subspace H0(y) to itself, but mapsH0(y) to some H0(y′).Fort∈ S,πx,γ(St)η=/summationdisplay/an}bracketle{tγ,t/an}bracketri}htajξt+sj∈ H00because if sjbelong to the same equivalence class, then so do theelements sj+t, sinceσsj+t(x) =σt◦σsj(x) =σt(σs(x))where [sj] = [s] for allj. /squareLemma 3. H0∩H(y) =H0(y).Proof.We can write H00as the algebraic direct sum of the finite dimen-sional, orthogonalsubspaces H0(y)asyruns through S(x).The closureofH00,H0,is thus the l2direct sum of these orthogonal subspaces. /squareRemark5.IfH(y) were not finite dimensional, then H0(y) is dense inH(y).In that case, H0⊃ H(y) and the conclusion of the Lemma fails.LetQdenote the orthogonal projection of l2(S) onto the subspaceH0.LetH1=Q⊥(l2(S)).Observe that for any basis vector ξt∈l2(S), Q⊥ξt/ne}ationslash= 0.Indeed, if Q⊥ξt= 0,thenξt∈ H0and in factξt∈ H0(y) where y=σt(x).But ifH0(y) contained one basis vec-tor, it would then contain all basis vectors in H(y) and hence H0(y)would coincide with H(y), which is not the case.SinceH0is invariant, we can define the representation π0x,γto be therestriction of πx,γto the subspace H0.The subspace H1need not beinvariant, but we can define the representation π1x,γbyπ1x,γ(F) =Q⊥πx,γ(F)|H1.Note that Q⊥ξs/ne}ationslash= 0 for all s∈ S.For simplicity of notation, if γ= 1 is the trivial character, writeπx,1=πx, π1x,1=π1x.12 DUNCAN AND PETERSDefinition 7.

Furthermore, μ(s,y)/ne}ationslash= 0for alls∈ Sandy∈ S(x).Proof.Lets, t∈ Sandy∈ S(x), y=σu(x).Thenμ(t,y)μ(s,σt(y)) =||Q⊥ξt+u||||Q⊥ξu||||Q⊥ξs+t+u||||Q⊥ξt+u||=||Q⊥ξs+t+u||||Q⊥ξu||=μ(s+t,y),verifying the cocycle identity.Suppose uj, j= 1,...,nare elements of Ssuch that if yj=σuj(x)∈S(x) are distinct, and σt(yj) =σt(y),1≤j≤n,wherey=y1=σu(x)andu=u1.The vectors Uj=1||Q⊥ξuj||Q⊥ξujare mutually orthogonal unit vec-tors, and ξ=/summationtextajUjis a unit vector if aj∈Csatisfy/summationtextnj=1|aj|2= 1.Nowπ1x(St)ξ=/parenleftbigg/summationdisplayaj||Q⊥ξuj||/parenrightbiggQ⊥ξt+u=/parenleftbigg/summationdisplayaj||Q⊥ξt+u||||Q⊥ξuj||/parenrightbigg1||Q⊥ξt+u||Q⊥ξt+uSinceπ1x(St)iscontractive, ||π1x(St)ξ|| ≤1.Hence, thescalar |/summationtextaj||Q⊥ξt+u||||Q⊥ξuj||| ≤1,for all choices of ajsuch that/summationtextnj=1|aj|2= 1.By Cauchy-Schwarz,this implies that/summationdisplay/parenleftbigg||Q⊥ξt+u||||Q⊥ξuj||/parenrightbigg2≤1.In other words,/summationdisplayjμ(t,yj)2≤1.Finally,μis never zero since Q⊥ξs/ne}ationslash= 0 for all s∈ S./squareSEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 13Withμthe left regular orbit cocycle, define W:l2(S(x))→ H1asfollows: if y∈ S(x),sayy=σs(x),setWξy=1||Q⊥ξs||Q⊥ξs.ThenWmaps an orthonormal basis of l2(S(x)) onto an orthonormal basis ofH1.We computeW∗π1x,γ(St)Wξy=W∗π1x,γ(St)1||Q⊥ξs||Q⊥ξs=/an}bracketle{tγ,t/an}bracketri}ht1||Q⊥ξs||W∗Q⊥ξt+s=/an}bracketle{tγ,t/an}bracketri}ht||Q⊥ξt+s||||Q⊥ξs||W∗1||Q⊥ξt+s||ξt+s=ρx,γμ(St)ξσt(y)Also,astraightforwardcalculationshowsthat W∗π1x,γ(f)Wξy=ρx,γμ(f)ξy.This provesCorollary 3.

Given a dynamical system ( X,σ,S) we say that thedynamical system ( Y,β,S) is an extension of ( X,σ,S) if there is acontinuous surjection p:Y→Xsuch that the diagramYβs− −− →Yp/arrowbtp/arrowbtXσs− −− →Xcommutes for every s∈ S. We call pthe extension map of ( Y,β,S)over (X,σ,S).We say that an extension ( Y,β,S) is ahomeomorphism extensionof (X,σ,S) if the maps βsare homeomorphisms for all s∈ S. Wenow provide a procedure for producing a canonical homeomorphismextension of ( X,σ,S).LetG=S −Sbe the group generated by the abelian semigroup S.(Recall that Sis a semigroup with cancellation.) Define a partial orderonGbyh < gifg−h∈ S.LetXg=Xforallg∈ G.Ifg−h=u∈ SletσumapXg→Xh.Then the commutativity conditions for an inversesystem are satisfied, so the inverse limit (or projective limit) of theinverse system exists. Denote the inverse limit by /tildewideX.14 DUNCAN AND PETERSProposition 2. /tildewideX={(xg)g∈G∈ΠXg:xh=σu(xg)for allh < g∈G,withu=g−h}.Proof.This is [2, Proposition 16-6.4]. /squareWe now show that there is a homeomorphism /tildewideσt,for eacht∈ S.Let/tildewideσtbe the map /tildewideσt((xg)g∈G) = (σt(xs))s∈G,and letp:/tildewideX→Xbe themapp((xs)s∈G) =x0(where 0 is the identity of G.)Proposition 3. (/tildewideX,/tildewideσ,S)is a dynamical system for which the /tildewideσtarehomeomorphisms, for all t∈ S.Furthermore, the diagram/tildewideX/tildewideσt− −− →/tildewideXp/arrowbtp/arrowbtXσt− −− →Xcommutes, so that (/tildewideX,/tildewideσ,S)is a homeomorphismextensionof (X,σ,S).Proof.We first see that /tildewideσtis surjective. Indeed, let (( yg)g∈G)∈/tildewideX,andsetxg=yg+t.Then (xg)g∈G∈/tildewideX,and/tildewideσt((xg)g∈G) = (yg)g∈G.To show injectivity suppose(xg)g∈G,(x′g)g∈G∈/tildewideXand/tildewideσt((xg)g∈G) =/tildewideσt((x′g)g∈G).Then for all g∈ G, xg−t=x′g−t.Hence (xg)g∈G= (x′g)g∈ G./squareCorollary 4. Gacts as a group of homeomorphisms on /tildewideX.Proof.Letg∈ G.SinceS − S=G, gcan be written as s−t,fors, t∈ S.Define/tildewideσg=/tildewideσs◦/tildewideσ−1t.We show this is well defined. If also g=s′−t′,thens+t′=s′+t.Hence,/tildewideσs+t′=/tildewideσs′+t.From this we obtain /tildewideσs◦/tildewideσ−1t=/tildewideσs′◦/tildewideσ−1t′./squareOur next goal is to show that the extension ( /tildewideX,/tildewideσ,S) is a minimalextension of ( X,σ,S) in a sense we will make precise.Lemma 5. Ifσtis a homeomorphism for all t∈ S, then the map p:/tildewideX→Xis a homeomorphism. Hence the dynamical systems (X,σ,S)and(/tildewideX,/tildewideσ,S)are conjugate.SEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 15Proof.We need only show that the map pis injective, since by Def-inition 8 it is a continuous surjection. So assume that p((xs)s∈S) =p((ys)s∈S). In particular x0=y0. Now since σtis a homeomorphismwe have that xs=σ−1s(x0) =σ−1s(y0) =ysand hence pis injective.That the systems are conjugate follows from the commutative diag ramfor the notion of extension. /squareDefinition 9. Consider an extension ( Y,β,S) of (X,σ,S) via an ex-tension map r. We say that an extension ( Z,φ,S) of (X,σ,S) liesbetween ( Y,β,S) and (X,σs,S) if the following diagramYβt− −− →Yp/arrowbtp/arrowbtZφt− −− →Zq/arrowbtq/arrowbtXσt− −− →Xcommutes for all t∈ S,andq◦p=r,wherepandqare the extensionmaps as in the diagram.We say the extension ( Y,β,S) of (X,σ,S) via an extension map ris ahomeomorphism extension if the maps βt, t∈ Sare homeomor-phisms, for t∈ S.Finally, we callahomeomorphism extension ( Y,β,S)of (X,σ,S)minimal if for any dynamical system ( Z,φ,S) that lies be-tween the two systems as in the diagram, the extension map pis ahomeomorphism, and hence ( Y,β,S) and (Z,φ,S) are conjugate sys-tems.We refer to the homeomorphism extension ( /tildewideX,σ,S) of (X,σ,S) asthecanonical homeomorphism extension.Lemma 6. The canonical homeomorphism extension of (X,σ,S)is aminimal extension.Proof.Assume that we have the following commutative diagram/tildewideX/tildewideσt− −− →/tildewideXp/arrowbtp/arrowbtZφt− −− →Zq/arrowbtq/arrowbtXσt− −− →X16 DUNCAN AND PETERSwhere/tildewideσtandφtare homeomorphisms for every tandpandqaresurjections with q◦p((xs)s∈S) =x0. By the preceding lemma we knowthat/tildewideZandZare conjugate and hence we will show that /tildewideZand/tildewideXareconjugate.Fornotationalpurposeswewillinterchangethenotations x= (xs)s∈Sfor an element of /tildewideXas necessary. We define a map Γ : /tildewideX→/tildewideZbyΓ((xs)s∈S) = (φ−1s(p(x)))s∈S. The map Γ is clearly continuous. On theotherhandnoticethat φt(φ−1s+t(p(x))) =φ−1s(p(x))andhenceΓ( x)∈/tildewideZ.Now if (ys)s∈S∈/tildewideZthen there exists x∈/tildewideXsuch that p(x) =y0sincepis surjective. Also ys=φ−1s(y0) and hence Γ( x) = (ys)s∈Sand henceΓ is onto.To see that Γ is one-to-one consider the map Π : /tildewideZ→/tildewideXgiven byΠ((ys)s∈S) = (q(ys))s∈S.Notice that φt(q(ys+t)) =q(φt(ys+t)) =q(ys) and so the map Π doesmap into /tildewideX. Now we see thatΠ◦Γ(x) = (q(φ−1s(p(x))))s∈S= (q(p◦/tildewideσs−1(x)))s∈S= (q◦p((xt+s)t∈S))s∈S= (xs)s∈S=x.It follows that Γ is one-to-one and hence Γ is a homeomorphism. Theconjugacy follows immediately from the commutative diagram. /squareThe next theorem now follows immediately.Theorem 1. The dynamical system (X,σ,S)has a minimal homeo-morphism extension, which is unique up to conjugacy.5.1.DUALIZING THE CANONICAL HOMEOMORPHISMEXTENSION. LetA=C(X), andαsbetheendomorphism αs(f) =f◦σs, s∈ S, f∈C(X).Define a partial order on Sbyt≻sif thereexistsu∈ Ssuch that t=u+s.Now the diagramAαs− −− → Aαt/arrowbtαu/arrowbtA Acommutes, so we can form the inductive system ( A,αs) with respect tothe order ≻.Let/tildewideA= lim− →(As,αs) whereAs=Afor alls, and let ιsbethe canonical embeddings of A →/tildewideA.Thus we have the commutativeSEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 17diagramAαs− −− → Aιt+s/arrowbtιt/arrowbt/tildewideA /tildewideANow we define /tildewideαs:/tildewideA →/tildewideAas follows: if /tildewidea∈/tildewideAthere exists a t∈ Sanda∈ Asuch that /tildewidea=ιt(a).Define/tildewideαs(/tildewidea) =ιt(αs(a)).This is well defined by the commutativity of the diagrams. Sinceαs, s∈ S,is linear and injective, the same is true for /tildewideαs.We show/tildewideαsis invertible.Let/tildewidea∈/tildewideAbe given; say /tildewidea=ιt(a) for some t∈ S, a∈ A.We canassumet≻s,sayt=u+sfor some u∈ S.Then/tildewidea=ιt(a) =ιu◦αs(b)for some b∈ A.Thus,/tildewidea=/tildewideαs(/tildewideb) where/tildewideb=ιu(b).Now the mappings αs, ιt,(s, t∈ S) are isometric and∗-maps (i.e.αs(a) =αs(a) ) hence /tildewideAis the direct limit of C∗-algebras, so that thecompletion of /tildewideAis a commutative C∗-algebra, C(Z). The automor-phisms/tildewideαsare isometric on /tildewideA, hence extend to automorphisms, alsodenoted /tildewideαs, ofC(Z).Thus, by the Banach-Stone Theorem, there is ahomeomorphism φsofZsuch that /tildewideαs(f) =f◦φs, f∈C(Z), s∈ S.Letjbe the embedding C(X)/mapsto→C(/tildewideX) given by j(f) =f◦pwherep:/tildewideX→Xis the canonical map. Now for s∈ Sletβs:A →C(/tildewideX) bethe map βs(f) =j(f)◦/tildewideσ−s.Then the diagramAαu− −− → Aβs/arrowbt βs+u/arrowbtC(/tildewideX) C(/tildewideX)commutes. Thus, by properties of direct limits, there is a star homo -morphism Ψ : /tildewideA →C(/tildewideX).Since the maps βsare isometric, so is Ψ ,hence Ψ extends to a map (also denoted Ψ) of C(Z)→C(/tildewideX).Now the embedding C(Z)→C(/tildewideX) yields a map p:/tildewideX→Zasfollows: let /tildewidexbe a pure state on C(/tildewideX),which we identify with a pointof/tildewideX.Restricting /tildewidex|C(Z)yieldsapurestateof C(Z),whichiscanonicallyidentified with a point of Z.18 DUNCAN AND PETERSWe observe that the diagram/tildewideX/tildewideσs− −− →/tildewideXp/arrowbtp/arrowbtZφs− −− →Zcommutes. By the minimal extension property of /tildewideX(cf Lemma 6), pisa homeomorphism. Thus, C(/tildewideX) is the (completion of) the direct limitof the directed system ( C(X),αs).6.THE C∗-ENVELOPETheorem 2. The C∗-envelope of the left regular algebra A(X,S)is thecrossed product C(/tildewideX)⋊ ̃αG.Proof.Define representations /tildewideπˆx,γforx∈Xandγ∈Γ of the crossedproductC(/tildewideX)⋊ ̃αGas follows. Let ˆ xbe the subset p−1(x)⊂/tildewideX,wherepis the map /tildewideX→Xgiven in Definition 3. The Hilbert space isl2(G(ˆx)),whereG(ˆx) denotes the union of the orbits G( ̃x) for  ̃x∈ˆx.IfUgis the unitary element in the crossed product associated with thehomeomorphism /tildewideσg,the representation is given by/tildewideπˆx,γ(Ug)ξ ̃x=/an}bracketle{tγ,g/an}bracketri}htξ/tildewideσ( ̃x)whereξ ̃xis the function in l2(G(ˆx)) which is 1 at  ̃ xand zero elsewhere.And for  ̃f∈C(/tildewideX),/tildewideπˆx,γ( ̃f)ξ ̃x= ̃f( ̃x)ξ ̃x.Since the direct sum of the representations  ̃f→ ̃f|ˆx(that is, therestriction of  ̃fto the subset ˆ x⊂/tildewideX) ofC(/tildewideX) is faithful, it follows thatthe the supremum of the norms of the representations /tildewideπˆx,γis faithfulon the crossed product, since Gis abelian, hence amenable. (cf [19,7.7.5]) Indeed, this holds even if γis taken to be the trivial character.SinceC(X) is embedded in C(/tildewideX) by the map j(f) =f◦p,it followsthat/tildewideπˆx,γ(j(f))ξ ̃y=f(y)ξ ̃yfor  ̃y∈ S( ̃x) withp( ̃y) =y∈X,sincej(f)is constant on the subset ˆ y⊂/tildewideX,and that constant is f(y).LetF∈ A0,sayF=/summationtextSsfs(where the sum if finite), let /tildewideF=/summationtextUsj(fs).Then we have that||/tildewideπˆx,γ(/tildewideF)||=||πx,γ(F)||.It follows that equality holds for F∈ A(X,S) and hence that theembedding of the left regular algebra A(X,S) into the crossed productiscompletely isometric. Wewill also denotethisembedding by j,whichis consistent if we view C(X) as a subalgebra of A(X,S) andC(/tildewideX) asa subalgebra of the crossed product.SEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 19To complete the proof, suppose Bis the C∗-envelope of A(X,S),andletk:A(X,S)→ Bbe the completely isometric embedding. Thenthere is surjective C∗-homomorphism Φ : C(/tildewideX)⋊ ̃αG → Bsuch thatthe diagramA(X,S)j− −− →C(/tildewideX)⋊ ̃αGid/arrowbt Φ/arrowbtA(X,S)k− −− → Bcommutes. It remains to show that Φ is an isomorphism. Suppose, tothe contrary, there is an element H∈ker(Φ).We may suppose Hhasnorm 1.Hcan be approximated by an element Gwith||G−H||<14,whereG=/summationtextni=1Ugihiwithhi∈C(/tildewideX).From Section 5.1 there exist fi∈C(X) such that ||j(fi)−hi||<14n,1≤i≤n.Thus ifF=/summationtextUgij(fi),then||F−G||<14.Now express gi=si−ti,wheresi, ti∈ S,1≤i≤n.LetU=Ut1···Utn=Ut1+···+tn.ThenFU∈j(A(X,S)),and since Uis unitaryin the crossed product, ||FU||=||F||.Now||H−F||<12,so that||Ψ(H−F)||<12.Since||H||= 1,thisimplies||F||=||FU||>12.Hence,||Ψ(HU−FU)|| ≤ ||Ψ(H−F)||||Ψ(U)||≤ ||Ψ(H−F)||<12whereas, since Ψ( H) = 0,||Ψ(HU−FU)||=||Ψ(FU)||>12since, by the defining property of the C∗-envelope, Ψ is completelyisometric on j(A(X,S)).This contradiction shows that the kernel of Ψis trivial, and so the crossed product is the C∗-envelope./squareCorollary 5. Givenx∈X, γ∈Γ,(1)The semigroup πx,γ(Ss) (s∈ S)of commuting isometries dilatesto a commuting semigroup of unitaries;(2)Assume xhas the finite stability property. Then semigroupρx,γ(Ss) (s∈ S)of commuting contractions dilates to a com-muting semigroup of unitaries.20 DUNCAN AND PETERSTheorem 3. There is a completely contractive representationΠ :C(X)⋊σS → A(X,S).Proof.LetF∈ A0.The norm of Fas an element of the semicrossedproductC(X)⋊σSis given as the supremum over all representations||π(F)||which satisfy the three properties of Definition 2. The normofFas an element of the left regular algebra A(X,S) is given as thesupremum over a subset of these representations. Since the sem crossedproduct is the completion of A0in the larger norm, for F∈ A(X,S),we may takeΠ(F) =⊕(x,γ)∈X×Γπx,γ(F).This yields a contractive map of the semicrossed product into A(X,S).To see the map is completely contractive, the proof of Theorem 2shows that the representation πx,γ(F) is unitarily equivalent to therestriction of /tildewideπˆx,γ(F) to an invariant subspace. Since this is a C∗-representation, it is completely contractive, and the same is true o fthe direct sum of such representations. Thus the map Π is complete lycontractive. /squareRemark6.If the map Π is not completely isometric, then it would beinteresting to have examples of representations πfor which the norm||π(F)||is not dominated by the norm of FinA(X,S).Conceivablysuch representations could be orbit representations for which th e asso-ciated orbit cocycle is not the left regular orbit cocycle. Of course, theexistence of such cocycles will depend on the semigroup S.For, say ifS=N,then the semicrossed product norm and the left regular normcoincide. More generally, what condition on the dynamical system Sis needed to insure that the two norms are different?Recall the maps Ps:A(X,S)→ A(X,S) defined in Section 3 Now,with abuse of notation, we define the conditional expectation P0onC(/tildewideX)⋊ ̃αG.in the same way it was defined on A0,byP0(F) =/integraldisplayΓτγ(F)dγwhere now τγacts on the group G.Notethat P0mapsontothesubalgebra C(/tildewideX)U0.Ifweregard A(X,S)as a subalgebra of its C∗-envelope, then the map P0of Section 3 coin-cides with the restriction of this map P0toA(X,S).Proposition 4. P0is a faithful, completely contractive conditional ex-pectation of A(S,X)→C(X).SEMIGROUPS AND OPERATOR ALGEBRAS 21Proof.ForF∈ A0, F=/summationtextSsfs(finite sum), P0(F) =f0whereS0=I. So it is evident thatP0(fF) =fP0(F) =P0(Ff)for anyf∈C(X).We see that for F∈ A0as above,P0(F∗F) =/summationdisplay|fs|2and in particular,(‡)P0(F∗F)≥ |fs|2=Ps(F)∗Ps(F)for anys. So, by continuity of P0and density of A0,it follows that ‡holds for F∈ A(S,X).Now suppose F∈ A(S,X) andP0(F∗F) = 0.Then it follows thatPs(F) = 0 for all s∈ S.So, by Proposition 1, F= 0.The map F∈ A(X,S)→τγ(F)is completely isometric. As P0is theaverage of completely isometric maps, it is completely contractive. /squareCorollary 6. There is a completely contractive conditional expectationC(X)⋊σS →C(X)Proof.By Theorem 3 the map Π of C(X)⋊σSontoA(X,S) is com-pletely contractive, and by Proposition 4 the conditional expectat ionofA(X,S) ontoC(X) is completely contractive. The conditional ex-pectation on the semicrossed product is the composition of the twomaps. /square6.1.SHILOV MODULES.Definition 10. LetAbe an operator algebra, π:A → B(H) a rep-resentation. Then πis said to be a Shilovrepresentation if there is arepresentation Π of the C∗-envelope C∗(A) in a Hilbert space Kcon-tainingHas a subspace, so that (viewing Aas a subalgebra of C∗(A),π(F) is the restriction of Π( F) toH,for allF∈ A.[12] expressesthis in the language of modules: His isomorphic to a submodule of Kviewed as an A-module.A Hilbert module His said to have a Shilov resolution if there is ashort exact sequence of Amodules0→ K0→ KΦ→ H →0whereK0andKare Shilov modules.22 DUNCAN AND PETERSLetH0, π1x,γ,H1, π1x,γbe the Hilbert spaces and representationsintroduced prior to Definition 7. While these were initially defined asrepresentations of A0,they are uniquely extendible to representationsofA=A(X,S),anditisthiscontext weconsider themhere. Following[12], we employ the language of Hilbert modules.For the remainder of this section let us fix x∈Xwhich has thefinite stability property, and γ∈Γ.ViewH0as anAmodule via therepresentation π0x,γ,H1as anAmodule via the representation π1x,γ,andl2(S) as anAmodule via the representation πx,γ.Theorem 4. (1)l2(S)is a Shilov module;(2)H1has a Shilov resolution0→ H0→l2(S)Q⊥→ H1→0.Proof.(1) Theorem 2 shows that for F∈ A, πx,γ(F) is unitarily equiv-alent to the restriction of the representation /tildewideπˆx,γ(F) of the C∗-envelopeto an invariant subspace.(2) Since πx,γis a Shilov representation of A,so is its restriction toan invariant subspace. Thus H0is a Shilov module. Since H1is thequotient space l2(S)/H0,it has a Shilov resolution as given in (2). /squareAgain fixing x∈Xandγ∈Γ,and letμ=μxbe the left regularorbit cocycle, and ρx,γμthe associated representation of the orbit spacel2(S(x)),which we view as an A(X,S) module via this representation.Corollary 7. As a left A-module, the orbit Hilbert space l2(S(x))hasa Shilov resolution.Proof.This follows from Corollary 3 in which it is shown that ρx,γμisunitarily equivalent to π1x,γ. /squareRemark7.Forx∈Xas above, the family of commuting contractions{ρx,γ(St) :t∈ S}dilates to a commuting family {πx,γ(St) :t∈ S}ofisometries, which in turn has an extension to a commuting family ofunitaries acting on l2(G).Acknowledgements.
